  GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP<i></i> <br>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Global citizenship, one might say, 
  is a kind of super-citizenship - the familiar idea of rights and duties of membership 
  in a civic group, only taken to a higher power, which is the power of the entire 
  planet. The central idea is that global citizens spend time each day thinking 
  about their responsibility to maintain not only the health of their particular 
  city, state, and country - but also about the civic and moral duties they owe 
  the planet and its people. <br>
  <br>
  Global citizenship has its own heroes and a history that runs parallel to, and 
  usually just below the visible surface of the more prominent social and political 
  practices and theories of every age. Today, thanks to 9/11 and global warming 
  and many other striking contemporary proofs of our endangered world, the idea 
  may finally be coming into its own. <br>
  <br>
  There are roughly nine major paths towards global citizenship. Any person who 
  on a daily basis tries to reconcile the pressing needs of his or her family, 
  career, and community with the inner urge to act each day somehow for global 
  betterment, will find spiritual ancestors and some practical advice in one or 
  more of these paths: <br>

  Citizenship is membership, but it is also remembering, with the first and most 
  essential memory being that of dependence for our lives as individuals upon 
  the good health and the goodwill of the global community of human beings. And, 
  upon the environmental health of the planet. <br>
  <br>
  This is not always an easy thing to remember even within the cozy confines of 
  family, city, or nation. It's all the more difficult then when our fellow citizens 
  - those with whom we need to vividly remember our connection -- live in foreign 
  countries far away and out of sight of our daily lives. <br>
  <br>
  Adam Smith remarked in an essay that if a European man lost his little finger 
  in an accident, he would be thrown into a torment. Yet that same man, "provided 
  he never saw them, would snore with the most profound security over the ruin 
  of a hundred millions of his brethren" in China. <br>
  <br>
  Today, thanks to CNN and a hundred other news sources, we would most certainly 
  see in graphic visual detail the ruin of millions of Chinese, if God forbid 
  that calamity came to pass. Yet we also know, for reasons Smith could not have 
  foreseen, that our sleep usually remains undisturbed by the suffering of peoples 
  half a world away. Millions of human souls in recent years died violently in 
  North Korea, Sudan, the Congo and a half dozen other hell spots on Earth in 
  the 1990s, for instance, without disturbing American sleep much. Responding 
  only to what their audience ratings meters tell them they should do, our TV 
  news media interlinks reports of the war in Iraq with bulletins on Michael Jackson's 
  pedophile case and the latest other nonsense, and on an on it goes, distracting 
  us hour after hour and year after year, until one day it's too late. Then a 
  killer flu virus arrives from China, or a pollution cloud floats in from Canada, 
  or a terrorist-piloted jumbo jet explodes on our own shores. Then and only then 
  we pay attention. <br>
  <br>
  To a large degree, those catastrophes are the direct result of not regularly 
  remembering and acting upon the vital life connection we know exists between 
  ourselves and the other inhabitants of our planet, especially those who live 
  very different lives in a land far away, until it is too late. <br>
  <br>
  Until recent years, pondering cosmopolitanism was mainly a pastime of the elite 
  for whom it was either necessary business or diverting pastime, such as wealthy 
  international traders, diplomats, or philosophers. The elites who ran the great 
  European colonial empires all had a cosmopolitan view; as did the early explorers 
  of Portugal and Spain; and the globe-trotting Jesuits who were as greedy for 
  global souls as merchants were for gold and spices. Renaissance philosophers 
  like Hugo Grotius spun theories of international law straight from their vision 
  and genius, without having much practical daily application. Similarly, the 
  Greek stoics, the first forefathers of anyone who tries to forge a cosmopolitan 
  outlook today, philosophized on the equality of all mankind while blithely owning 
  household slaves themselves. <br>
  <br>
  Yet the inconsistencies and incomplete theories of these global-thinking pioneers 
  make them no less useful to us today. No doubt we will have to update, modify, 
  and ultimately transcend their example as mankind goes on, if it is lucky, to 
  successfully complete the next step in its ever-expanding consciousness. We 
  had better soon become global thinkers or all die as local ones. But one thing 
  is sure, which is that whatever new global consciousness arises, it will grow 
  out of the ideas passed down from those who have put them, such as they are 
  today, already in our minds. The new theory will have to save what is useful 
  to today from the global thinking pioneers, and kick away what is useless or 
  false. The first step is to become consciously aware of the ideas that already 
  move us and limit us from our own living past. <br>
  <br>
  <a name="reason"></a><b>1. The Path of Reason</b> <br>
  <br>
  Patron Saint: Socrates Main Idea: Reason and virtue are universal values of 
  mankind. Followers: The Stoic philosophers (Zeno, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius), 
  the Cynic philosophers (Antisthenes, Diogenes, Crates), Hugo Grotius, Immanuel 
  Kant, Martha Nussbaum. <br>
  <br>
  "I am neither an Athenian nor a Greek, I am a citizen of the world," said the 
  sage of Athens (quoted by Plutarch). As such he was perfectly democratic in 
  his application of the standards of reason across all borders and with all comers. 
  Applying reason to belief, individually and personally, citizen by citizen, 
  was Socrates' way. For him good ideas could come from anywhere in the world. 
  Spreading these ideas to the young men of Athens got Socrates killed; yet in 
  submitting to the will of Athens that he be executed, instead of choosing exile, 
  Socrates showed the limits of his cosmopolitanism. The Stoic schools took the 
  cosmopolitical aspect of his thinking to greatest extreme, arguing that the 
  entire world was entirely material and endowed with reason and soul, and it 
  was thus every individual's role, wherever they may live on the earth, to live 
  according to the dictates of rational nature. The Renaissance philosopher Hugo 
  Grotius built the first system of international law out of the notion that all 
  humans are rational and social, and thus are bound in a moral world that transcends 
  national boundaries. When Immanuel Kant wrote "perpetual peace is guaranteed 
  by no less an authority than the great artist Nature herself," he picked up 
  where the Stoics left off. His essay "Perpetual Peace," arguing for universal 
  peace based on universal laws, is the manifesto of many modern cosmopolitans. 
  Martha Nussbaum extends the theme in many writings, such as Cultivating Humanity, 
  in which she argues for spreading liberal arts education (Socratic style) globally 
  as a way to support the growth of freedom, democracy, and human rights. <br>
  <br>
  <a name="faith"></a><b>2. The Path of Faith</b><br>
  <br>
  Patron Saint: Albert Schweitzer Main Idea: Service to God by revering and supporting 
  all life. Followers: Augustine of Hippo, St. Francis, St. Paul, G.K. Chesterton, 
  Reinhold Neibuhr, Mother Theresa, Habitat for Humanity <br>
  <br>
  "As long ago as my student days, it struck me as incomprehensible that I should 
  be allowed to live such a happy life while I saw so many people around me wrestling 
  with care and suffering," Schweitzer scrawled on a notepad only a week before 
  his death in Gabon, Africa. "There gradually grew up within me an understanding 
  of the saying of Jesus that we must not treat our lives as being for ourselves 
  alone." As a result, Schweitzer sacrificed a promising career as a concert organist 
  in Europe to go to medical school and then move permanently to Africa as a medical 
  missionary. By giving up his cushy life to follow Jesus' call to live for others, 
  Schweitzer both followed, and established his credentials, as a modern avatar 
  of the path of the missionary - usually but not always in modern history, a 
  Christian. Faith not reason is the motivational spring of these cosmopolitans. 
  God's plan, not man-in-progress, is the engine of human history. Humanist critics 
  point to the many crimes of Christian missionaries and of the evangelical urge; 
  yet the fact remains that missionaries more than any others, until the multinational 
  corporation was invented, have overcome the gravity of local life in order to 
  travel the world, to endure loneliness, to learn foreign languages, to befriend 
  foreign people, and even to die in foreign lands having religiously converted 
  others but been entirely culturally converted themselves. Religious humanitarian 
  groups such as Catholic Relief Services and Lutheran World Relief are among 
  the largest and most active NGO's serving refugees and the world's poor today. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name="democracy"></a><b>3. The Path of Democracy</b> <br>
  <br>
  Patron Saint: Woodrow Wilson <br>
  <br>
  Main Idea: Global political, legal, and trade cooperation. <br>
  <br>
  Followers: Jonathan Schell, Vaclav Havel, the League of Nations, the United 
  Nations, the International Court of Justice, the World Trade Organization. <br>
  <br>
  These global citizens see global health primarily as the absence of war, with 
  world peace arising primarily by individual action taken in the political sphere. 
  The government's role is to work with other nations towards global cooperation 
  in all matters of common interest including health, humanitarian relief, education, 
  the environment, and armed police actions when necessary. Citizenship to them 
  implies individual action through voting, vocal political dissent, and other 
  means of pressuring governments toward these ends. A few Wilsonians see the 
  world ideally evolving towards a single global federalism; most favor continued 
  national sovereigns working ever more closely through international treaties, 
  protocols, laws, and practices that are backed by public opinion. To them, Woodrow 
  Wilson's idea for the League of Nations - especially his principles of democracy, 
  freedom, self-determination, and the rule of law - was not proved fatally flawed 
  by the League's failure; rather it was a noble idea ahead of its time. The most 
  prominent Wilsonian today is Jonathan Schell who argues in The Unconquerable 
  World that the string of strikingly non-violent democratic revolutions that 
  occurred in the late 20th century in the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, 
  South Africa, South Korea, Indonesia, Spain, and other countries is evidence 
  that America's present military dominance goes against the grain of history 
  - which shows the might of people power. <br>
  <br>
  <a name="humanitarian"></a><b>4. The Humanitarian Path</b> <br>
  <br>
  Patron Saint: Henri Dunant <br>
  <br>
  Main Idea: Humanitarian action based on universal human rights. <br>
  <br>
  Followers: Aryeh Neier, Paul Farmer, International Red Cross, Doctors Without 
  Borders, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International <br>
  <br>
  In 1862, Henri Dunant, a French businessman in northern Italy, witnessed one 
  of the bloodiest battles of the 19th century - Napoleon's armies driving the 
  Austrians out of Italy at the town of Solferino. Young Dunant, 34 at the time, 
  walked through the battlefield afterwards and saw scenes of unimaginable suffering 
  - soldiers shot through, their guts opened, missing arms and legs, but still 
  alive and with no medical or nursing help at all. Writing up the experience 
  in a small book called A Memory of Solferino, Dunant immediately poured all 
  his time and funds into travels around Europe to get governments to send representatives 
  to a conference to address the problem of wounded soldiers and prisoners of 
  war. The 1864 conference drew up the Geneva Convention which codified rules 
  for the treatment of wounded and prisoners, and formed the Red Cross. The phrase 
  "human rights" would not become current for another 90 years, but the Red Cross 
  became the first transnational humanitarian organization based on the idea of 
  human rights. The group's fundamental principles then as now were humanity, 
  impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and universality. 
  After World War II, especially after the United Nations General Assembly passed 
  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, human rights groups have 
  proliferated by the thousands, creating a global civil society composed of "non-governmental 
  organizations" working transnationally through aid efforts and conferences. 
  In addition, the language and law of human rights has become a pillar of U.S. 
  foreign policy, used in the justification and adjudication of numerous foreign 
  military and humanitarian projects. Human rights activists in the United States 
  have given the movement special impetus by transferring to the global human 
  rights movement many of the political, organizational, and ideological practices 
  and beliefs of the U.S. civil rights movement of the 1960's. <br>
  <br>
  <a name="ecological"></a><b>5. The Ecological Path</b> <br>
  <br>
  Patron Saint: Rachel Carson <br>
  <br>
  Main idea: Living in harmony with nature is a key to peace. <br>
  <br>
  Followers: Aldo Leopold, Sigurd Olson, Arne Naess, Edward Abbey, Wendell Berry, 
  Bill McKibben, World Wildlife Fund, World Conservation Union, Greenpeace <br>
  <br>
  Ecological consciousness is the Copernican revolution updated to modern times: 
  it puts mankind not at the center of the universe but rather in one small if 
  critical corner in the great web of life. Backed by the authority of modern 
  science, the ecological view holds that the health of the whole earth depends 
  on the health of all the parts, with a flaw or cancer in any part possibly leading 
  to the death of all. Theoretically, this insight could lead to a humble politics, 
  one that takes into account the possible consequences of every action not only 
  locally but throughout that web of life, including the citizens of faraway lands. 
  Aldo Leopold, the author of the ecological classic "A Sand County Almanac," 
  connected ecology and civics when he wrote of man being "a plain member and 
  citizen of the biotic community." Leopold's friend and colleague, the naturalist 
  Sigurd Olson, hiked in the wilderness of northern Minnesota and believed it 
  offered lessons of global import: "Harmony of knowledge, will, and feeling toward 
  the earth is wisdom, for it has to do with living at peace with other forms 
  of life. Since the beginning of civilization, harmony with nature has been almost 
  disregarded, though it has been recognized by a few great minds as the only 
  solution to the problem of finding peace and contentment." Sooner or later every 
  environmental writer comes to roughly the same conclusion. Putting the earth 
  first - biocentrism trumping anthropocentrism -- inevitably makes all men citizens 
  in stewardship of their common home, the glistening blue sphere of Earth. <br>
  <br>
  <a name="free trade"></a><b>6. The Free Trade Path</b> <br>
  <br>
  Patron Saint: Adam Smith <br>
  <br>
  Main Idea: Unregulated global capitalism improves everyone's life. <br>
  <br>
  Followers: Milton Friedman, F.A. Hayek, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, libertarians, 
  multinational corporations (except when protectionism suits them better) <br>
  <br>
  The British liberal economist and moral philosopher Adam Smith theorized in 
  1776 that every man, "intending only his own gain" in making and selling goods, 
  was actually working for the benefit of all men, whether he was conscious of 
  this or not. In so doing, Smith invented a notion - the invisible hand of the 
  free market - which remains one of the most powerful globe-encircling ideas 
  to this day. The key notion is the price system, which magically finds a specific 
  trading point at which parties on both sides of the transaction are satisfied. 
  In other words, economics isn't always brutish competition with a winner and 
  a loser. In a free market, everyone can win. This idea became the foundation 
  of "neoliberal" economics that, under the leadership of Ronald Reagan and Margaret 
  Thatcher, fueled the phenomenal growth of globalization in the post-war period. 
  With Milton Freedman's "Capitalism and Freedom" as their bible, neoliberal policymakers 
  in the 1980s and 1990s drove vast global programs of government-led privatization. 
  Global financiers used the philosophy to rationalize moving vast amounts of 
  investment funds in and out of foreign banks in search of the highest returns. 
  By the middle 1990s, the downsides of these policies, such as the destructive 
  impact of investment funds suddenly withdrawn from an entire national economy, 
  or the crushing financial terms imposed on foreign countries by the International 
  Monetary Fund, had drawn thousands of protesters to annual conferences where 
  global economic bodies (such as the World Trade Organization) met. The Nobel 
  prizewinning economist Joseph Stiglitz and the journalist William Greider have 
  both offered penetrating critiques of the free trade or "neoliberal" path, while 
  also acknowledge the tremendous good that economic globalization has done. The 
  enduring allure of the free trade path to the global citizen is captured by 
  its modern prophet Milton Friedman: "When you buy your pencil or your daily 
  bread, you don't know whether the pencil was made or the wheat was grown by 
  a white man or a black man, by a Chinese or an Indian. The price system enables 
  people to cooperate peacefully in one phase of their life while each one goes 
  about his own business in respect of everything else." <br>
  <br>
  <a name="feminist"></a><b>7. The Feminist Path</b> <br>
  <br>
  Patron Saints :The women of Mandal village, Uttar Pradesh, India <br>
  <br>
  Main idea: Feminine values are universal, practical, civic, and green <br>
  <br>
  Followers: Carolyn Merchant, Carol Adams, Carol Gilligan, Elizabeth Spelman, 
  Women's Environment and Development Organization, the Gorilla Foundation, Feminists 
  for Animal Rights <br>
  <br>
  The odd name comes from the Hindi word for "hugging," which is what the village 
  women of Mandal in northern India did to the trees in a nearby forest in 1973, 
  when logging companies threatened to clear-cut them. The protest was spontaneous 
  and the women refused to budge even as the bulldozers charged, as if they were 
  protecting their own children. It was Ghandi's principle of non-violent resistance 
  or satyagraha, put at the service of a forest, just as Ghandi had used it to 
  win independence for India. The fact that women often are on the front lines 
  of environmental battles around the world, and that they often find common cause 
  despite language and cultural barriers, suggests the feminist view has much 
  to offer aspiring global citizens of either gender. In particular, feminist 
  group action not only on global environmental issues but also on social and 
  economic justice issues is often marked by intense collaboration, open and free 
  discussion, listening, and compromise. Further, feminist writers like Carol 
  Gilligan and Elizabeth Spelman have argued that women tend to develop mastery 
  of relationship maintenance skills to a higher degree than men. Gilligan's idea 
  that women tend to follow an "ethic of care" as opposed to men's "ethic of justice" 
  seems especially apt in a global citizenship perspective. The ethic of justice 
  looks to abstract moral principles as guides to action, while the ethic of care 
  stresses attention to the particular case and person, being open to different 
  outcomes and stressing the maintenance of personal relations in each case to 
  the degree possible. Virtues often exercised more naturally by women than men 
  - hospitality, modesty, restraint, kindness, and the impulse to repair - these 
  feminists argue, are the indispensable virtues to any global civic life. <br>
  <br>
  <a name="corporate"></a><b>8. The Corporate Path</b> <br>
  <br>
  Patron Saint: Rev. Leon Sullivan <br>
  <br>
  Main idea: Doing business globally with a social conscience. <br>
  <br>
  Followers: Business in the Community, Business for Social Responsibility, Robert 
  Haas, David Grayson, Anita Roddick, Simon Zadek, Levi Strauss & Co., The Body 
  Shop <br>
  <br>
  As economic globalization progressed in the 1990s, a backlash formed among critics 
  who saw it as a form of empire, enslaving a new generation of underpaid workers 
  in third world countries to wealthy first-world masters. Riots in Seattle in 
  1999, where the World Trade Organization had its annual meeting, showed the 
  depth of the anti-corporate sentiment. That confrontation and others led to 
  the rise of the latest trend in doing business with a social conscience, known 
  as CSR for "corporate social responsibility." Cynics say CSR is a branch of 
  corporate public relations. It is true that while several companies, such as 
  Levi Strauss and The Body Shop, put significant resources into social programs, 
  no companies have scored notable successes in the social and profit categories 
  simultaneously. The patron saint of this path, the Rev. Leon Sullivan, built 
  a worldwide network of self-help worker training centers and in 1971 joined 
  the board of General Motors, becoming the first African-American to hold a board 
  seat on a major corporation. In 1977 he authored the "Sullivan Principles," 
  a human rights code of conduct for U.S. and other multinationals operating in 
  South Africa, while apartheid was still the law there. By getting American companies 
  in South Africa to commit to equal opportunity employment for black as well 
  as white employees, the Sullivan Principles turned multinational corporations 
  into agents for social change that led ultimately to the end of apartheid in 
  South Africa. This example, at least, shows that multinational corporations 
  can and sometimes do play a critical role as global citizens by expanding human 
  rights and democracy worldwide. Environmental and labor cases involving major 
  multinationals like Nike, Union Carbide, and others tend to grab headlines. 
  Yet the overseas staffs of U.S. multinationals, which numbering about two million 
  U.S. citizens, create a de facto overseas diplomatic corps for the United States 
  that shows a human face of America to the world - a great act of citizenship. 
  Also for every factory worker scandal, U.S. multinationals also offer employment, 
  and social and educational opportunities to foreign workers that they could 
  never otherwise afford. History also shows that multinational firms are sensitive 
  to pressure from consumer protests and NGOs, which have driven companies towards 
  increasing social accountability over the years. Working as "expatriate" employee 
  of a multinational remains the most practical path available to most Americans, 
  to experience global citizenship firsthand.<br>
  <br>
  <a name="perennial"></a><b>9. The Perennial Path</b> <br>
  <br>
  Patron Saints: Mahatma Ghandi and Martin Luther King <br>
  <br>
  Main idea: Spiritual oneness through shared suffering and renouncing ego empowers 
  people and secures the world. <br>
  <br>
  Followers: Michael Lerner, Ken Wilber, Jacob Needleman, Joseph Goldstein, Marianne 
  Williamson, Huston Smith, Joseph Campbell <br>
  <br>
  What did the Buddha say to the hot dog vendor? "Make me one with everything." 
  The "unitive knowledge of the divine Ground of being" is how Aldous Huxley put 
  it in The Perennial Philosophy, summarizing the universal truth that is taught 
  at the oft-shrouded heart of the world's great religions: "All is one." Each 
  of us is in essence but a tiny shard of a single Godhead. It's an obvious insight 
  to many, yet hard to translate into meaningful civic action. Today's followers 
  of the Perennial Path are trying to find just such practical paths by which 
  individuals can turn their spiritual search into effective global citizenship. 
  Jacob Needleman, the historian and philosopher, speaks of the need for America 
  to overcome its intensely selfish worldview by building a "community of conscience," 
  one citizen at a time. America's founding fathers provide ideal mythic models 
  from which each citizen can be reassured that the possibility for true greatness 
  can be tapped by seeking the light of divinity within. That act puts man "in 
  accordance with his structure and nature as an image of God" and allows him 
  to fulfill his highest purpose: "Namely to care for the inner divinity and through 
  that to care for our neighbor." The New Age philosopher Ken Wilber suggests 
  that a widespread breakthrough in consciousness to a "worldcentric" view, which 
  previously has been the domain of social elites, may be the next step in human 
  evolution that began with egocentrism (self-focus), and then successfully progressed 
  then to sociocentrism (partially subjugating the needs of self to the needs 
  of the group). "In this transformation," Wilber writes, "from the sociocentric 
  to the worldcentric, the self de-centers once again: my group is not the only 
  group in the universe, my tribe is not the only tribe, my god is not the only 
  god, my ideology is not the only ideology." Some Perennial Path leaders, such 
  as the Buddhist teacher Joseph Goldstein, say that working spiritually to eradicate 
  the sources of conflict within oneself, such as through meditation, is possibly 
  the highest form of peace work that a human being can do. Others, like Marianne 
  Williamson, say that at some point well before reaching enlightenment, individuals 
  must explicitly engage in civic life. This very engagement can itself be fuel 
  for continued spiritual growth: "Where people join, breakthroughs occur," she 
  says. "Where we are separate from each other - angry, polarized, and defensive 
  - breakdown and disorder are inevitable. The way to heal social disorder, domestically 
  or internationally, is to find our spiritual oneness. We don't need deeper analysis 
  of our sickness so much as we desperately need a more passionate embrace of 
  the only thing that heals them all." <br>
