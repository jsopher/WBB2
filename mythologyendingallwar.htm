  and The Lord of the Rings: A Mythology of Ending All War<br>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Every generation seeks to identify 
  with some mythology that helps them find meaning in the world. For Generation 
  X, it was the Star Wars Trilogy. For Generation Y, it is the Matrix and Lord 
  of the Rings. The violent stories in these mythological trilogies speak to a 
  new generation coming of age in a world with growing prospects for new wars. 
  It is also a world where our politicians talk about the impending crisis with 
  terrorism as a battle between good and evil.<br>
  <br>
  Evil is a fitting word for those who experienced the mind-numbing violence of 
  September 11th, 2001. The kind of destruction and suffering wrought by the terrorists 
  was clearly an act of war. When the U.S. sanctioned an escalation of this war, 
  the continued destructive and hideous forms evil took became easier to justify. 
  The same evil caused by the hijackers smashing their planes into the World Trade 
  Towers was also manifest in the killing of thousands of defenseless civilians 
  in Iraq and Afghanistan, even though it was done with the intention of removing 
  regimes who were obstacles to peace and freedom. War is evil, but a necessary 
  evil when trying to win back peace and a nation's shattered dignity.<br>
  <br>
  The human pulse of war and peace has been continuously beating for as long as 
  our history has recorded. This fact might make one wonder if they are two sides 
  of the same, forever unchangeable, evolutionary coin. But when we see how powerful 
  our weapons have become and how much suffering and destruction they can bring, 
  how can we not seek to resolve a way to keep the peace and end all wars forever?<br>
  <br>
  It is the theme of fighting war for peace that runs strong in both The Matrix 
  and Lord of the Rings. In The Lord of the Rings, it is a "fool's hope" that 
  compels the heroes of the story to fight Sauron and seek to destroy the One 
  Ring, the backbone of his power that has perpetuated an endless war over Middle 
  Earth. In the Matrix, Morpheus holds onto a religious like faith that Neo will 
  save humanity by bringing the eternal war against the machines to a final end.<br>
  <br>
  Because our history has been a long succession of wars, we identify with the 
  themes of these stories even though we don't fight against machines or some 
  monstrous entity like Sauron. The eternal war we have been fighting for thousands 
  of years has always been waged against ourselves. The great enemy is us. Humanity 
  is at war with itself.<br>
  <br>
  A disturbing exhibit at the United Nations in New York City expresses the reality 
  of our ridiculous situation. A chart depicts what humanity spends in preparations 
  for war. Our world military expenditures top $780 billion dollars a year. Every 
  ten minutes, $9 million dollars is spent around the world on weapons. Consequently, 
  the money needed to fight some of the other great problems threatening us is 
  only peanuts in comparison to the bloated military budgets that feed the military-industrial 
  machine.<br>
  <br>
  The following statistics were found at the same U.N. exhibit. Only $50 billion 
  dollars a year would provide clean, safe energy for everyone. $30 billion could 
  forgive the developing nations' debts. $24 billion could prevent soil erosion 
  threatening our food supply. $21 billion could provide health care and control 
  AIDS. Another $21 billion could provide housing for the world's homeless. $19 
  billion could end starvation and malnutrition. $16 billion could prevent acid 
  rain and global warming. $15 billion could stop ozone depletion, illiteracy 
  and provide relief for the world's refugees. $14 billion could eliminate nuclear 
  weapons and stop deforestation. $10.5 billion could keep the population from 
  spinning out of control. Another $10 billion could provide safe, clean water 
  for all. $4 billion could remove the world's landmines and help spread democracy. 
  For a grand total of $234.5 billion dollars, we could move our Earth closer 
  to enduring peace and further from the injustices that ignite wars. That's over 
  a hundred billion dollars less than the annual military budget of the United 
  States. <br>
  <br>
  If we have the resources that might help us end the eternal war being fought 
  within humanity, why don't we use them? If we have the means to end the gross 
  imbalances already setting us up for the next world war, why is so little being 
  done? In the Lord of the Rings, this theme of wasted opportunity plays out in 
  the story. In the early days of Middle Earth, humanity had the chance to destroy 
  evil once and for all. But because of greed and the lust for power, Isildur 
  threw away his chance to destroy the One Ring forever.<br>
  <br>
  The same theme in this story is very familiar in our world today. Most of those 
  living at the top refuse to destroy their greed and lust for power by using 
  their abundant resources to help transform the infrastructure of those at the 
  bottom. The gross imbalance of humanity's priorities has set the stage for World 
  War III.<br>
  <br>
  Viewing a photograph of the Earth at night shows the imbalances that have continued 
  to mount. The United States, Europe and Japan are lit up like Christmas trees. 
  The combined population of these industrialized and developed nations is around 
  800 million people. The dimmer areas of the planet constitute the almost five 
  billion human beings who live in developing nations, two billion of which live 
  on two dollars a day and less. Africa can be seen on this map as the heart of 
  darkness. Only a few sparse lights break the dark shroud of an entire continent 
  with a population of 800 million people. Today we sustain an order where 14% 
  of the world's population control 65% of the world's resources and produce most 
  of the world's destructive levels of CO2. This vast and ugly imbalance on our 
  Earth can't continue forever. Unless something intervenes and ends business 
  as usual, these imbalances will continue to mount until they reach a breaking 
  point.<br>
  <br>
  The natural world has been known to have mechanisms in place that break imbalances 
  down when they manifest for too long. When forests get clogged with too much 
  dead and decaying timber, fires cleanse away the imbalance and help the ecosystem 
  start over fresh. Could World War III be a similar mechanism? Is the great hatred 
  for the West among the poor nations just a fiery movement of evolution that 
  will lead to the eventual break down of developing countries whose greed has 
  clogged the excess vital nutrients needed for the Earth body of humanity to 
  achieve balance?<br>
  <br>
  Many people from within the West look at their society like the ship builders 
  and crew looked upon the Titanic, believing that this technological masterpiece 
  was unsinkable. But perhaps evolutionary mechanisms also work from the inside. 
  Like a cancer eating away even the most fit, arrogance and greed have been known 
  to crumble empires from within. It happened to the Roman Empire and Edward Gibbon 
  took note of it in his famous book, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.<br>
  <br>
  Gibbon made three distinct observations about why the greatest empire on earth 
  was defeated by primitive barbarians from the north. The first factor was caused 
  by the greed of Roman people, who kept trying to sustain the status quo in the 
  face of war, and social and political meltdown. The second were the escalating 
  attacks on the Empire from the outside. The third was the apathy and unwillingness 
  of its citizens to get involved with politics, whose primary concern was the 
  afterlife and not the world their children would be inheriting from them.<br>
  <br>
  If we examine America today, these three factors are trying to take hold. The 
  September 11th attacks have been a wake-up call for some, yet many still believe 
  life can go on as usual. Vast resources are being poured into efforts to fight 
  terror through military action but not enough is being done to alleviate the 
  desperate third world poverty and imbalances that help create terrorists. Will 
  an extended occupation of Iraq bring us peace and stability or a chain reaction 
  of terrorist strikes with more war? There are many Americans who see unavoidable 
  war and impending chaos ahead in the Middle East as a welcome sign of the End 
  Times. In this paradigm, the promised bliss of the afterlife negates any concern 
  for the world's condition they leave behind.<br>
  <br>
  If humanity was unable to stop World War I and World War II from starting, the 
  logical conclusion is that World War III is inevitable. But how can we resign 
  ourselves quietly to the evolutionary forces that will break down our imbalances 
  while causing the deaths of hundreds of millions of people all over the world? 
  Is there something we can do to transcend our evolution and challenge fundamentalist 
  perspectives that view such destruction as necessary before the anticipated 
  Judgment Day comes? We must all come to realize that the judgment is every moment 
  and how we choose to proceed now will determine our fate.<br>
  <br>
  The evolutionary forces that shape human nature also help shape the theologies 
  of religions, which are in turn reflected in the plots of many popular movies. 
  In Christianity, Jesus is like Neo, the One who was sent to save the world. 
  Those who believe in him also have faith that he will return and do what many 
  believe we cannot: bring about the end of the eternal war on Earth. The Devil 
  is like Agent Smith, who is hell-bent on stopping Neo and continuing to be ruler 
  of the world which has been dominated from the beginning by violence and the 
  law of the jungle.<br>
  <br>
  Although there are those who believe the Devil is real and that he is in part 
  responsible for humanity's fall from grace, many other educated people see the 
  law of the jungle as a fact of evolution. War and the survival of the fittest 
  have dominated life here for millions of years. There is, however, a transcending 
  quality in evolution that is unique to human beings. It is something that counteracts 
  the destructive side of our nature and allows for organization and ultimately 
  the construction of great civilizations. Altruism, compassion and nonviolence 
  are relatively young in humanity but could potentially make a sizeable impact 
  against the R-complex of society's collective brain and its propensity for violence. 
  The R-complex refers to the aggressive reptilian base of our brain which in 
  its evolution has been transcended with higher functioning. Unfortunately our 
  society's higher functioning has yet to transcend the council of fear and aggression 
  from militant political leaders, who like the R-complex, push us into war.<br>
  <br>
  Clearly we can see that there is a longing in most human beings to live in a 
  world at peace. For those societies who have enjoyed peace for great lengths 
  of time, the tantalizing prospects of our potential combined with a benevolent 
  application of technology make us hunger for a harmonious way of life that war 
  can never touch. At the same time there is a revulsion felt by many towards 
  the prospects of World War III and the devastation it would bring.<br>
  <br>
  This brings us back to the appeal of our movies and the similar intellectual 
  threads running through them. All the heroes of Lord of the Rings and The Matrix 
  hunger for peace and an end to war. As Morpheus says in Matrix Reloaded, "What 
  if tomorrow the war could be over? Isn't that worth fighting for? Isn't that 
  worth dying for?"<br>
  <br>
  The idea of fighting for peace and an end to all war is the driving theme in 
  both these stories. But when we examine this effort in the real world, doesn't 
  fighting for peace just bring more war? Al Qaeda attacks America, America attacks 
  Al Qaeda and Iraq. This never-ending succession of violence only breeds more 
  violence until one has utterly smashed and destroyed the other. But with today's 
  weapons and climate of hate directed at us from the Middle East, this may not 
  be obtainable until millions of people on both sides have been murdered.<br>
  <br>
  The evolutionary forces of war and violence will most likely rear their ugly 
  heads again and again until we transcend the primitive side of our evolution 
  to complete the non retrogressive phase in humanity's advancing social evolution. 
  Just as the United States brought about an enduring peace between north and 
  south after the Civil War, an enduring world peace will only come about when 
  East and West join together under the benevolent order of a democratic global 
  government with human rights for all. Perhaps it is a fools hope to believe 
  this can be done non violently but this method should be pursued if we want 
  to avoid a violent fate where humanity takes a long detour into another dark 
  age after the widespread use of weapons of mass destruction.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of the first Matrix movie, Neo speaks on the phone to the powers 
  who run the Matrix, a system of control and oppression which has kept humanity 
  at war and blinded to their true potential for peace. The same can be said about 
  our system dominating the Earth today. It is an order of control and oppression 
  that profits when we wage wars against each other. Generations X and Y must 
  speak out against this intolerable situation with Neo's spirit of defiance but 
  within the context of non violence. We must reject the way of war if we are 
  not to play into the hands of the old order and its rejection of the idea that 
  an enduring world peace is not only possible but inevitable.<br>
  <br>
  "I know you're out there... I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us. 
  You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell 
  you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. 
  I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what 
  you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you, a world 
  without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries, a world where anything 
  is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you." --Neo, The 
  Matrix</font><br>
