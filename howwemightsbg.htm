  but it's also a vision of possibilities.</i></font><br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">NEW YORK (Rooters) - At a press conference today 
  at the United Nations on the second anniversary of the tragic events of September 
  11, 2001, a diverse coalition of world leaders, celebrities, Nobel Laureates, 
  and non-governmental organizations called for "a just and democratic new world 
  order."&nbsp; </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img SRC="images/mandela.jpg" HSPACE=5 height=229 width=182 align=RIGHT>The 
  ambitious plan, spelled out in a 347-page document titled "One World: A Plan 
  for Just &amp; Democratic Global Governance," was endorsed at the conference 
  by a who's who of&nbsp; political, religious, cultural, scientific, and corporate 
  leaders that included statesmen Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter, and Mikhail Gorbachev, 
  religious leaders Pope John Paul II, the Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, 
  and His Holiness the Dalai Lama, entertainers Jessica Lange, George Clooney, 
  Susan Sarandon, and Martin Sheen, and NGOs Amnesty International, Oxfam, and 
  Doctors Without Borders.&nbsp; </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"We are living in a global village that is victimized 
  daily by war and the constant threat of war and by an international state that 
  borders on anarchy. Like the founding fathers of the United States of America, 
  we must create `a United States of the world,' with a twenty-first century constitution 
  to safeguard the planet and all its creatures," said veteran broadcaster and 
  world federalist, Walter Cronkite. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"The greatest hope for a solution to humanity's 
  gravest problems - war and terrorism, poverty, tyranny, the destruction of the 
  environment - lies in the creation of a democratic world government," said the 
  Pope by satellite from the Vatican. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The document, co-authored by 32 prominent experts 
  on government, international law, defense, economics, the environment, and related 
  subjects is a joint project of nearly two hundred NGOs coordinated by the World 
  Federalist Movement (WFM), which has long advocated a federation of the world's 
  nations with phased disarmament at the national level and the creation of a 
  strong global peacekeeping force. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In introducing the paper, former U.S. presidential 
  candidate John B. Anderson, now President of the World Federalist Association 
  (WFA), the American branch of WFM, noted that world government has been championed 
  by many of the greatest thinkers and political figures of history, including 
  Albert Einstein, John F. Kennedy, Winston Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi, Woodrow 
  Wilson, philosopher Bertrand Russell, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William 
  O. Douglas, and even Socrates.&nbsp; </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Anderson argued that the world is caught between 
  anarchy ("a global wild west"), undemocratic domination by the world's current 
  superpower, the United States, and potential superpowers-to-be, like China, 
  mayhem by terrorists and armed rogue states, and the "unchecked influence of 
  mighty transnational corporations" and "economic globalization without the political 
  globalization of our most fundamental human values."&nbsp; </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"None of us would tolerate such chaos in our own 
  countries," Anderson said. "So why do we tolerate it on the world scale? We 
  must move without delay to convert the United Nations into a true federation 
  of the world's countries with the power to democratically, constitutionally, 
  and representatively legislate and govern at the global level." </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img SRC="images/Bono.JPG" HSPACE=5 BORDER=0 height=253 width=200 align=LEFT>In 
  a satellite hookup from Australia, Irish rock singer and activist Bono reached 
  out to his contemporaries in the antiglobalization movement. "We've all heard 
  about globalization of power and globalization of profit and globalization of 
  greed until we're blue in the face," he said. "It's time to balance the books 
  with globalization of peace, globalization of freedom and justice, globalization 
  of prosperity and opportunity. If we want it, we can have it." </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to the "One World" document (available 
  in print and soon online in 62 languages at www.worldgov.org), the WFM-led coalition 
  is launching a campaign "to make the issue of just and democratic global governance 
  and its allied concept of world citizenship a staple of `the conversation' - 
  in TV and radio studios, living rooms and board rooms,&nbsp; town halls and 
  concert halls around the world," said former WFM President, the British actor, 
  writer, and human rights activist Peter Ustinov. "Oh yes, and I mustn't forget 
  'chat rooms,'" the Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF added. "Every day, something 
  happens in the world - or fails to happen - that should be the province of an 
  enlightened world government, and our Campaign for Just and Democratic Global 
  Governance [CJDGG] will miss no opportunity to point that out to the increasingly 
  self-conscious world citizenry, which some have recently dubbed 'the Superpower 
  of Peace,'" Ustinov said. "We shall henceforth take on the role of loyal opposition 
  to the current, unelected world administration," Ustinov added. "Our goal is 
  to replace the current coalition of the willing with a coalition of the willing 
  and able to speak and do right for all the world's peoples, not a select few." 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ustinov announced that the CJDGG will be producing 
  global citizenship programming - including talk shows, newsmagazines, and documentaries 
  - for TV, radio, and the Internet, organizing "global town halls" at real and 
  virtual (online) locations, and producing curricula on global citizenship and 
  related issues for schools and universities.&nbsp; </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Global democratic and constitutional self-governance 
  should be one of the ABCs of citizenship, from childhood on," added media magnate 
  Ted Turner, who will be spearheading the broadcast campaign. In 1997, Turner 
  pledged $1 billion to the UN which he is paying in ten annual installments.&nbsp; 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"We believe that when people understand the pros 
  and cons of a world without just, democratic governance and a world with it, 
  they will vote overwhelmingly for global self-determination over global anarchy 
  or quasi-dictatorship," Anderson said.&nbsp; </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"World government is not only possible, it is inevitable," 
  added Ustinov, "and when it comes, it will appeal to patriotism in its truest 
  sense, the patriotism of men and women who love their national heritages so 
  deeply that they wish to preserve them in safety for the common good." </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To help launch the campaign, a Concert for One 
  World will be held on Saturday, September 13, at 24 far-flung locations. "We 
  have over 300 artists and groups who'll be performing as far afield as Central 
  Park in New York City and a huge stadium in Doha, Qatar," said concert coordinator 
  Peter Gabriel. The concert, which will be broadcast live in most countries and 
  on the Internet, will feature such stars as Paul McCartney, U2, Miriam Makeba, 
  Luciano Pavarotti, Joan Baez, and Youssou N'Dour, and speaking appearances by 
  Nelson Mandela and Desmund Tutu at the concert in Johannesburg and Jimmy Carter 
  and Kofi Annan at the concert in Central Park.</font> <br>
