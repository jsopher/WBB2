  The primary function of government is protecting the lives of its citizens. 
  Wise governments also ensure their citizens' freedoms. The most immediate and 
  severe threat to both of these government functions is the growing and inevitable 
  threat of infectious diseases. Human death, disability, poverty or loss of freedoms 
  on a global scale from natural or engineered pathogens still hold great promise 
  for catastrophic impact on the course of human progress and history. Humanity 
  has the means to prevent or avoid most of this carnage but most people continue 
  to live in dangerous denial.<br>
  <br>
  There has been progress in humanity's war on infectious diseases, but they remain 
  the single greatest source of human death and suffering in the world today. 
  Some estimates suggest that over a hundred million people died as a result of 
  war and over 180 million people in genocides over the last 100 years. Infectious 
  diseases killed about four times more innocent people than war and genocide 
  combined during that same century. The majority of those who died were children.<br>
  <br>
  A new plague tomorrow could kill well over a hundred million people in a matter 
  of months. Most virus experts agree that a new strain of killer flu, as lethal 
  as the 1918 strain that killed over 40 million people in 18 months, is long 
  overdue. An intentional or accidental release of smallpox or a new weaponized 
  strain of smallpox or some other infectious pathogen could kill hundreds of 
  millions of people and disrupt civilization. AIDS, West Nile virus, and SARS 
  are only our most recent wake up calls. The loss of antibiotic effectiveness, 
  the continued evolution of natural pathogens and the accidental or intentional 
  abuse of biotech experiments with other pathogens, combined with rapid global 
  transportation, trade, injustice and poverty give little reason to be optimistic 
  about humanity's future.<br>
  <br>
  Less than 30 years ago, the US Surgeon General told Congress that infectious 
  diseases had been conquered, but by 1992 pathogens had moved from being the 
  fifth largest killer of Americans to third place -- a doubling of infectious 
  disease-caused deaths -- with HIV/AIDS responsible for half of that increase. 
  Since then, five uncontested reports authored by the Centers for Disease Control, 
  the Department of Defense, the National Security Council, the National Academy 
  of Sciences Institute of Medicine and even the US National Intelligence Council 
  have stressed that new and re-emerging infectious diseases are a significant 
  and growing threat to our nation's security and prosperity. Can the US federal 
  government or our advanced technology protect us? No.<br>
  <br>
  Our advanced technologies can help, but in many cases they actually make us 
  more susceptible to infectious disease. Widespread abuse of antibiotics, invasive 
  medical procedures, toxic environments and mass production/distribution food 
  systems only exacerbate our disease risks. Our advanced military technology 
  makes traditional war against the US suicidal for any conventional force. This 
  spurs the development of biological weapons of mass destruction that are infinitely 
  more affordable, difficult to defend against and almost impossible to detect.<br>
  <br>
  The dual use nature of biotechnology has effectively killed any hopes of disarming 
  those who committed to doing us harm. One of the greatest manhunts in human 
  history has yet to find the individual or the lab that brought the most powerful 
  nation's capital to a standstill with a few anthrax-tainted envelopes. Even 
  a military invasion and occupation of Iraq has yet to yield any conclusive evidence 
  of large amounts of Saddam's biological weapons. And we know he had them, at 
  least right before the first Gulf War -- because the US gave him over 40 shipments 
  of actual disease cultures.<br>
  <br>
  Many people still believe that national borders provide protection against disease, 
  but pathogens are not impeded by human ideas. Perhaps the most lethal human 
  concept is that of "national sovereignty" -- the institutionalized belief that 
  nations are independent from other nations. In reality, if even one nation in 
  the world lacks effective disease control, then all nations and all people are 
  at risk in this era of rapid mass transportation. And history has recently demonstrated 
  that just the belief that a nation might have biological or other weapons of 
  mass destruction can spark a war.<br>
  <br>
  If just one group of individuals is sufficiently alienated from the rest of 
  humanity, virtually nothing can stop them from developing or purchasing a biological 
  weapon that can make life miserable for the rest of humanity. A global government 
  truly of the people, by the people and for the people can establish a lasting 
  world civilization where human rights and freedoms are universally enforced. 
  We cannot eliminate the capacity to make biological weapons, but we can do something 
  about the desire to use them.<br>
  <br>
  When thinking about constructing a functional government system, most scholars 
  will point to the creation of our own nation's constitution and the three basic 
  structures of government: an elected body to represent the people and make laws, 
  a judicial system to enforce the laws, and an executive branch to administer 
  the laws. They often overlook the vital need for a bill of rights to give the 
  government legitimacy and thus more permanence. Access to basic health services 
  should be one of the inalienable human rights guaranteed by any constitutional 
  government. The basis of U.S.-style democracy is the right to "life, liberty, 
  and the pursuit of happiness". Without health, this is meaningless.<br>
  <br>
  Effective local disease control and prevention efforts will require effective 
  global disease control and prevention efforts. This isn't a new idea. Some of 
  the first efforts at global cooperation were disease control efforts. One of 
  the first problems that brought various nations together for mutual action was 
  the failure of disease quarantines by individual nations during the mid-1800s. 
  The Pan American Health Organization was one of the first international institutions. 
  It was created nearly 50 years before the UN and it was done primarily to further 
  US national security interests.<br>
  <br>
  Consistent and enforceable global standards for effective global surveillance, 
  response and prevention must become humanity's highest priority. This can only 
  be accomplished with a consistently enforceable global bill of human rights 
  and distribution of power at every level of government, including global government, 
  to minimize abuses. Current international institutions lack both the resources 
  and the enforcement mechanisms to effectively prevent or respond to outbreaks. 
  We need universal, enforceable health standards and laws.<br>
  <br>
  Infectious diseases have always been humanity's greatest enemy and protection 
  from them should be one of governments' highest priorities. As early as 1866, 
  experts argued that quarantine was no longer effective given the growth of international 
  trade and travel. The vulnerability of states today is similar to that of nineteenth-century 
  European states. In 1916, L. S. Woolf wrote, "the conflict fought by the theory 
  of national independence, isolation, and national interests against the facts 
  of international life and international interests has nowhere shown itself more 
  persistently and clearly than in the struggle of human beings against the scourges 
  of cholera, plague, and other epidemic diseases." This remains true today.<br>
  <br>
  Pathogens have shaped the fate of nations. They continue to mutate and grow 
  more dangerous with most aspects of unregulated globalization, from low wages 
  to unequal rights for women, from international crime to the response or lack 
  of response to armed conflict. Pathogens are changing. Can we?</font><br>
