  1. QUOTE OF THE MONTH<br>
  "[T]here is a deeper truth expressed in the unity of the United States. [I]mplicate 
  in the union of our country is the union of all people. [A]ll people are essentially 
  one. [T]he world is interconnected not only on the material level of economics, 
  trade, communication, and transportation, but innerconnected through human consciousness, 
  through the human heart, through the heart of the world, through the simply 
  expressed impulse and yearning to be and to breathe free." --Dennis Kucinich, 
  US congressman and presidential nomination candidate, "A Prayer for America"<br>

  World Beyond Borders has improved its "Projects, Past and Present" section. 
  This feature allows people to describe global government- and cosmopolitanism-related 
  events and projects and share information about it with others. This feature 
  is located in our Interactive Activities and Communication page -- click on 
  the "Projects, Past and Present" link. You can also go directly to <a href="projects.htm">www.worldbeyondborders.org/projects.htm</a>.<br>
  <br>
  We've also made it easier for people to spread WBB articles around to their 
  friends and family. With our "Tell a Friend" buttons, you just click, add up 
  to ten email addresses and then send our articles to whomever you wish. <br>
  <br>
  This month we also have some reprints. They are listed below by section: <br>
  <br>
  Why Global Government?<br>
  *"Coming Out as a Moral Cosmopolitan" by Jason Hill. The author argues for a 
  radical redefinition of the self. Your essence is not determined by such things 
  as race or nationality. <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/moralcosmopolitan.htm">www.worldbeyondborders.org/moralcosmopolitan.htm</a> 
  <br>
  <br>
  *"The Promise of World Peace" by the Baha'i Universal House of Justice eloquently 
  lays out the reasons for global government and the necessity of a conception 
  of human unity. Although this document comes from a religious body, it is worthwhile 
  reading for everyone, including the secular. <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/bahaiworldpeace.htm">www.worldbeyondborders.org/bahaiworldpeace.htm</a><br>
  <br>
  What Might It Look Like? <br>
  *"Space, World Government, and 'The End of History'" by Ian Crawford. Could 
  a peaceful united world avoid stagnation? The author, an astronomer, thinks 
  space exploration provides a way out and makes the case that space exploration 
  on a large scale could only be carried out by a global government. <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/iancrawford.htm">www.worldbeyondborders.org/iancrawford.htm</a>

  3. WHY A GLOBAL GOVERNMENT IS NEEDED TO STOP GLOBAL WARMING<br>
  by Eli Williamson-Jones<br>
  <br>
  News has recently surfaced of a Pentagon report concerning the great danger 
  global warming confronts us with. The report's authors, Doug Randall and Peter 
  Schwartz, were hired last October by Andrew Marshall, a high-ranking Pentagon 
  advisor who paid $100,000.00 for their services. The report warns that world-wide 
  anarchy could result from a shifting climate change brought on by neglecting 
  to curb the use of fossil fuels. <br>
  <br>
  Other details in the report predict wars over water use, fortification of North 
  America and Europe to stem the tide of refugees, massive flooding, crop failure 
  and the increased likelihood of nuclear war. Randall and Schwartz argued that 
  the catastrophe of global warming could come much sooner than most scientists 
  predict. The disastrous effects it would bring are the reason the authors recommend 
  the White House make this problem the top U.S. national security concern, even 
  ahead of the war on terror. <br>
  <br>
  There is much anger towards the Bush administration concerning this report and 
  many have accused the president of covering it up for as long he could. Even 
  the U.S. Defense Department downplayed the report, calling it too speculative 
  to bring to the attention of Donald Rumsfeld. Rob Gueterbock of Greenpeace was 
  infuriated by news of the cover-up. "You've got a president who says global 
  warming is a hoax, and across the Potomac river you've got a Pentagon preparing 
  for climate wars." <br>
  <br>
  Scientists have been warning humanity about our oil addiction for quite some 
  time now. It is time that the people vote into office a leadership that takes 
  these warnings very seriously. Even more importantly, it is essential that we 
  move in the direction of global government fast enough to deal with the protection 
  and health of the global commons that all the nations depend on for their well-being. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States can be irresponsible today and ignore the Kyoto protocol because 
  there is no higher governance to answer to. It would be absurd to think what 
  would happen if Mississippi decided to revoke the fifteenth amendment and refuse 
  African Americans the right to vote. It's just as absurd then that the United 
  States or another powerful nation can ignore the international community and 
  invade any nation they please. International law must make nations answer to 
  a higher authority and this is only possible through a global government. <br>
