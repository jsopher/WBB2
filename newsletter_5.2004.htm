  1. QUOTE OF THE MONTH<br>
  <br>
  "If you want to be on the leading edge of anything, you have by definition to 
  be a couple of standard deviations away from most people. That makes you an 
  odd-ball. The trick is to learn to accept it, then to like it -- and keep on 
  making lots of noise for what you believe in." --Charles Sheffield, physicist 
  and science fiction author <br>

  2. WHAT'S NEW AT WORLD BEYOND BORDERS<br>
  <br>
  This month at World Beyond Borders, thirteen new articles have been posted. 
  They have been taken from the old World Federalist Association website (<a href="http://www.wfa.org" target="_blank">www.wfa.org</a>) 
  and given a new home here. WFA became Citizens for Global Solutions last fall, 
  and visitors to wfa.org are redirected to<a href="http://www.globalsolutions.org" target="_blank"> 
  www.globalsolutions.org</a>, so their content's days appear numbered. We've 
  made it our duty to try and preserve the best of their essays. They are all 
  listed below by section. <br>
  <br>
  Why Global Government? <br>
  *Federalist Paper # 16 by Alexander Hamilton, who presented his argument as 
  to why the states should be transcended and included by a federal government, 
  over 200 years ago. <br>
  <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/federalist16.htm" target="_blank">www.worldbeyondborders.org/federalist16.htm</a><br>
  <br>
  *"The Law of Nations Ought to be Founded Upon a Federation of Free States" from 
  Perpetual Peace by Immanuel Kant. An argument for binding states with a federal 
  government. <br>
  <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/perpetualpeace.htm" target="_blank">www.worldbeyondborders.org/perpetualpeace.htm</a><br>
  <br>
  *"Community Making and Peace" from The Different Drum by M. Scott Peck. In this 
  essay, Peck argues that until we make such submission to international government 
  and community, it is inevitable that we continue to believe it proper for the 
  United States to be "the world's policeman", with all that entails. <br>
  <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/communitymaking.htm" target="_blank">www.worldbeyondborders.org/communitymaking.htm</a><br>
  <br>
  *"The Birth of the Global Nation" by Strobe Talbott, Time Magazine, July 20, 
  1992. Strobe Talbott argues that the best mechanism for global democracy is 
  a federation, a union of separate states that allocate certain powers to a central 
  government. <br>
  <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/globalnation.htm" target="_blank">www.worldbeyondborders.org/globalnation.htm</a><br>
  <br>
  *"From the Anatomy of Peace" by Emery Reves. Reves argues that the only way 
  to find security on the world stage is to institute the same kind of political 
  structures that give us security on the national stage.<br>

  <br>
  What Might It Look Like? <br>
  <br>
  *"Confrontation or Cooperation?" by Bill Clinton The U.S. former president looks 
  at federation as a good idea that could advance our humanity in the smaller 
  world of the 21st century. This is a rare thing -- a lively essay about the 
  idea of federalism. <br>
  <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/federalismconference.htm" target="_blank">www.worldbeyondborders.org/federalismconference.htm</a><br>
  <br>
  *"From the Great Rehearsal: The Story of Making and Ratifying the Constitution 
  of the United States by Carl van Doren". Van Doren takes a close look at the 
  most momentous chapter in American history. <br>
  <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/greatrehearsal.htm" target="_blank">www.worldbeyondborders.org/greatrehearsal.htm</a><br>
  <br>
  How We Might Get There? <br>
  <br>
  *"An Open Letter to the General Assembly of the United Nations" by Albert Einstein 
  lays out the argument that the UN now and world government eventually must serve 
  one single goal--the guarantee of the security, tranquillity, and the welfare 
  of all humankind. <br>
  <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/openletter.htm" target="_blank">www.worldbeyondborders.org/openletter.htm</a><br>
  <br>
  *"Beyond Vietnam" by Martin Luther King, Jr. King's essay looks at the violent 
  struggle in Vietnam and argues for non-violent solutions to global conflicts 
  as the only means for building a livable new world.<br>
  <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/beyondvietnam.htm" target="_blank">www.worldbeyondborders.org/beyondvietnam.htm</a> 
  <br>
  <br>
  *"The American Example" by Clarence Streit looks at the past of the United States 
  as an example for the world in how to unite diverse states into a single common 
  union. <br>
  <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/americanexample.htm" target="_blank">www.worldbeyondborders.org/americanexample.htm</a><br>
  <br>
  *"African Unity and World Government" by Joseph K. Nyerere gives arguments as 
  to why Africa should be transformed into a United States of Africa. <br>
  <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/africanunity.htm" target="_blank">www.worldbeyondborders.org/africanunity.htm</a><br>
  <br>
  *Resolutions Adopted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This resolution requesting 
  the U.S. Congress to invite all nations to unite in the formation of a world 
  state was adopted by Senate of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, February 23, 
  1915, and by its House of Representatives on February 26, 1915, as House Resolution 
  No. 1226.<br>
  <a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/massacusetts.htm" target="_blank">www.worldbeyondborders.org/massacusetts.htm</a><br>
  <br>
  *Resolution Adopted by the State of North Carolina This joint resolution (H.R. 
  338 Resolution 24) was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives of 
  North Carolina March 11, 1941, and by a vote of 45 to 5 by the Senate of North 
  Carolina on March 12, 1941. Contains principles and objectives for a Declaration 
  of the Federation of the World.<br>

  3. POLITICS BEYOND BORDERS?<br>
  by Jane Shevtsov<br>
  <br>
  In February, Greens Party members from 32 European countries voted to form the 
  European Greens, a unified political party. The Greens, who will run for seats 
  in the European Parliament, are the first political party to make this move. 
  While European nations retain their own military forces and can't be said to 
  be truly united, this move represents an amazing move. A friend of mine says, 
  "I grew up in a Europe that was between wars, the causes of which had historically 
  been border conflicts. The thought of Germany and France sharing a unified title 
  of "European Union" would have been scoffed at, and I would have been considered 
  of unsound mind to even think of it seriously." To get this far took decades, 
  but it wouldn't have happened at all if visionary minds had not stood up to 
  guide events.<br>
  <br>
  In the meantime, what can those of us outside Europe do to promote transnational 
  democracy and how can any of us be represented at the global level? One idea 
  is discussed by philosopher Peter Singer in his book _One World_. Singer proposes 
  that at least one (up to five are allowed) of a nation's representatives at 
  the UN General Assembly be elected. The transformative potential of this idea 
  is tremendous. How much easier the work many of us do to strengthen the UN will 
  become when people feel a stake in that organization! Furthermore, this change 
  can be undertaken by one country at a time. It can't be obstructed by the powerful.<br>
  <br>
  Another idea, supported by political writer George Monbiot, is the creation 
  of an independent world parliament. In his book _The Age of Consent_ (published 
  in the US as _Manifesto for a New World Order_), Monbiot writes, "Building a 
  world parliament is not the same as building a world government. We would be 
  creating a chamber in which, if it works as it should, the people's representatives 
  will hold debates and argue over resolutions. In the early years at least, it 
  commands no army, no police force, no courts, no departments of government... 
  But what we have created is a body which possesses something no other global 
  or international agency can claim: legitimacy." And there is room for further 
  growth. "The parliament's ability to review the decisions of the General Assembly 
  would reinforce the Assembly's democratic authority. We might anticipate a shift 
  of certain powers from the indirectly elected body to the directly elected one. 
  We could begin, in other words, to see the development of a bicameral parliament 
  for the planet, which starts to exercise some of the key functions of government."<br>
  <br>
  Which, if either, of these ideas will win out is unclear. We don't know when 
  or how global democracy will emerge. But that's just another way of saying that 
  the answer lies in our hands.<br>
