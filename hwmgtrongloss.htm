  of Concerned Philosophers for Peace on the theme "Reconciling Peace with Justice," 
  Chico, California, September 1997)<br>
  <br>
  I would like to address an issue not often discussed among philosophers (or 
  anyone else) but relevant to several of the specific questions and topics circulated 
  in connection with calls for papers for this conference. In the April 16, 1997 
  announcement from CPP Executive Director William Gay some of the suggested questions 
  to be considered were: "Is escape possible from power relations embedded in 
  language?" and "Is it possible to honor one's ethnic origins and identify with 
  all of humanity?" In the call for papers from Ron Hirschbein in Chico one of 
  the suggested topics was "Balancing/promoting inter-ethnic cooperation while 
  preserving diversity." While the issue I wish to discuss is related to these 
  topics, I am quite confident that those posing these questions and issues were 
  not thinking about the specific question I want to address. Nevertheless this 
  question is quite appropriate for a conference on the theme "Reconciling Peace 
  with Justice." This question is, How should we deal with the issue of which 
  language(s) to use in the rapidly evolving global community?<br>
  <br>
  In his 1993 CCP Presidential Address entitled "Linguistic Violence" William 
  Gay discussed various forms of linguistic violence. In the section of his address 
  entitled "Types of Linguistic Violence" he twice mentioned the issue of language 
  choice in a community. He said: "Beyond literacy is the issue of what language 
  is accepted as the official one and whose interest this decision favors and 
  in what ways others are oppressed by this decision."[i] He also said: "More 
  neglected in the literature is the way in which, under colonialism, the languages 
  of national groups in the third world have been relegated to an inferior status 
  in favor of a first-world language as the official one."[ii] These statements 
  point to the issue I wish to address. Professor Gay also raised another issue 
  at the end of that Presidential Address which is relevant to this question of 
  language choice for the world community, namely that the topic of change in 
  language and language policy is ultimately an issue where "politics comes first."[iii]<br>
  <br>
  The question of which language(s) should be used in the global community is 
  also related to Hirschbein's suggested topic of "Balancing/promoting interethnic 
  cooperation while preserving diversity." The need for communication and "interethnic 
  cooperation" throughout a rapidly evolving world community means that it is 
  very probable that only one or a few languages are going to be used for this 
  international communication. At the same time there are over 3,000 languages 
  in the world, 240 spoken by at least a million persons and thirteen of them 
  spoken by more than 100 million people.[iv] How can the need for efficient two-way 
  communication at the global level be reconciled with the need to preserve at 
  least some of this diversity?<br>
  <br>
  If we look at how this issue of achieving a resolution of the tension between 
  efficiency in communication and preserving diversity is being addressed in some 
  of the major international organizations of the day such as the United Nations 
  and the European Union, the situation is not very encouraging. In February 1946 
  the U.N. General Assembly decided that the United Nations would have five official 
  languages--Mandarin Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. There were 
  to be two working languages, English and French, in all the principal organs. 
  Arabic was added as an official language of the U.N. in 1980, and now all six 
  of the official languages have also become working languages in the General 
  Assembly.[v] Under the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, it is also 
  possible for delegates to use a language other than the six official languages 
  if they themselves provide interpretation into one of the six official languages. 
  In the 1992 session of the General Assembly, 12.5% of the speakers, the highest 
  proportion ever, used this option.[vi] But even though there seems to be a move 
  toward preserving at least some linguistic diversity in the public formal sessions 
  where presentations may be mainly for political show, in fact more and more 
  of the actual communication among the various national representatives at the 
  U.N. is taking place in informal private meetings where virtually everyone uses 
  English. Stephen B. Pearl, former Chief of English Interpretation at the U.N., 
  explains that this change reflects the fact that most countries have concluded 
  that the public debate which takes place at the U.N. is not that important anyway 
  because the decisions on how to vote are usually made in the national capitals. 
  Consequently, the delegates sent to the U.N. are sent there precisely because 
  they have the skill to operate in English, the language used in the informal 
  meetings.[vii] So we have a public performance where various languages are used 
  to make a point about the political status of the countries involved and then 
  behind-the-scenes meetings where the real dialogue and negotiating takes place, 
  almost entirely in English. There is a public show of diversity but a hidden 
  reality of uniformity where one language is rapidly shoving even the other official 
  languages out of business. Furthermore, even this outward show of diversity 
  is possible only because of a large staff of translators and interpreters. If 
  we think of the world language problem not just from the viewpoint of the leaders 
  of government and others who can afford to have translators and interpreters 
  at their beck and call, it becomes obvious that even the minimal diversity which 
  comes with six chosen major languages is not something that can function in 
  the world community as a whole.<br>
  <br>
  In the European Union we have a similar situation. At the formal level we have 
  the "principle of complete multilingualism," the principle that all representatives 
  in the European Parliament have the right to speak or to listen in their own 
  state language.[viii] That means that there were 9 official languages for the 
  12 countries in 1992, and now that Finland, Sweden, and Austria have become 
  members there are 11 official languages for 15 countries. The Language Service 
  already consumes more than half of the administrative budget of the European 
  Parliament,[ix] and as still more countries become members and new languages 
  are added, the situation will become untenable. Meanwhile other linguistic communities 
  such as the Catalans in Spain have pushed the European Parliament to declare 
  that all European languages, even regional rather than state ones, deserve recognition. 
  Catalan, however has still not been made an official language of the EC. Instead 
  the Catalans have been "encouraged to continue seeking some sort of other recognition," 
  though it is unclear what this would be.[x] Although the official policy is 
  the "principle of complete multilingualism" in the European Parliament and for 
  official documents, and although there is an understanding that both English 
  and French will be the working languages, there are some EC operations where 
  English has become the first among equals as far as actual language use is concerned.[xi] 
  English is meeting more resistance in Europe than at the United Nations, but 
  as long as the only solution being considered is to use some existing national 
  language, English is probably going to gradually eliminate the others.<br>
  <br>
  Suppose that for a moment we ignore what is actually happening and focus instead 
  on what kind of language policy should be adopted in order to reconcile the 
  need for cooperative action and the aim of preserving linguistic diversity. 
  What is the ideal way of dealing with this issue? Timothy Reagan of the University 
  of Connecticut has addressed the issue of "the role that can be played by language 
  planning and language policy in contributing to the reconciliation of the forces 
  for diversity and the pressures for unity."[xii] He cautions that the tension 
  between diversity and unity "is one that almost always goes far beyond language, 
  language differences, and language rights."[xiii] Although language is not the 
  only factor in disputes about ethnic differences and diversity, it is a powerful 
  symbol often linked with group identity and thus cannot be ignored. When he 
  turns his attention to the language situation in Europe, he observes that the 
  range of options on language policy and language planning can be arranged along 
  a "continuum of diversity," from an extreme where "all languages used on the 
  continent would be accorded equal status and rights" to the opposite extreme 
  of having a single language selected as the only one having official status.[xiv] 
  Neither extreme would be acceptable. The first is just unworkable while the 
  second would arouse intense opposition from the major languages not selected. 
  Reagan expects the Europeans to adopt a solution along the lines of what they 
  are already doing, namely, "the principle of complete multi-lingualism" with 
  each country having the option of naming one language. But, he notes, "Such 
  a solution is not really the most reasonable one" because it "inevitably requires 
  an immense expenditure in terms of interpreting, translation, and publications 
  services, and so on, while at the same time it will in essence favor the existing 
  'languages of wider communication' (such as English and French), and penalize 
  the smaller languages (e.g. Catalan, Danish, and so forth)."[xv]<br>
  <br>
  He then makes the point that "the use of a single, relatively neutral language 
  -- however one chooses to define 'neutrality' in this context -- in conjunction 
  with continued use of national, regional, and ethnic languages would provide 
  a possible alternative, both internationally and intranationally, and might 
  be both cheaper and more effective in the long run."[xvi] He then observes that 
  Esperanto could fill this role. What is especially noteworthy here is that Reagan 
  is not an Esperantist but a disinterested scholar just looking at the possibilities. 
  He goes on to list three pragmatic advantages of Esperanto as a single language 
  for Europe: (1) it is neutral as none of the national languages would be; (2) 
  it is demonstrably easier to learn than any of the European national languages; 
  and (3) it "already exists, has an international user population, and has an 
  extensive lexicon suited to contemporary needs."[xvii] Reagan also lists some 
  possible objections to Esperanto. They are: (1) it would represent a break from 
  the existing way of dealing with the language problem, in the process undoubtedly 
  arousing the opposition of interpreters and translators employed by the present 
  system; (2) the number of people already familiar with Esperanto is relatively 
  small; (3) there are widespread negative attitudes toward Esperanto, whether 
  such attitudes are rational or irrational. His final conclusion is: "Esperanto 
  would appear to offer considerable promise, and certainly giving it more serious 
  consideration than has been done in the past would not seem unreasonable."[xviii] 
  The use of a neutral language like Esperanto needs to be considered as a viable 
  way of getting linguistic efficiency while preserving linguistic diversity.<br>
  <br>
  This conclusion should not be surprising. When L. L. Zamenhof developed Esperanto 
  in the last part of the nineteenth century, he was motivated precisely by this 
  concern of providing for linguistic unity while preserving linguistic diversity. 
  He realized that a just language policy[xix] would involve developing a new 
  neutral language that would be no one's first language and everyone's second 
  language. Since it would be learned as a second language by everyone, it would 
  be necessary to make it relatively easy to learn. Since it was being constructed 
  as a new language, it would be possible to create a completely rule-guided and 
  totally phonetic language without the kind of grammatical and spelling irregularities 
  which create obstacles for those trying to learn existing national languages. 
  The grammar could be made simple by having one system of conjugation for all 
  verbs and just a few rules for other grammatical features. The vocabulary could 
  be borrowed to some extent from existing languages, especially from those Latin 
  roots common to many of the European languages. A system of rule-guided prefixes 
  and suffixes could be established which would permit the rapid expansion of 
  one's vocabulary by a logical system of word-building. Zamenhof presented his 
  language to the world in 1887, and it has been learned and used by large numbers 
  of people all over the world. The issue of how many Esperantists there are in 
  the world is complicated by the question of just how well persons must be able 
  to use the language before they are counted as Esperantists. There are about 
  50,000 persons who belong to some kind of official Esperanto organization, and 
  some informed persons estimate that "about 250,000 people throughout the world 
  speak Esperanto fluently, and one to two million can carry on a simple conversation 
  in it."[xx]<br>
  <br>
  If Esperanto is such an appropriate solution to the world language problem, 
  why has it not made more progress? Why do we hear so little about it? Here we 
  need to return to William Gay's point about the role of politics in determining 
  language policy. The national governments, especially the more powerful ones, 
  control the policy decisions in international bodies, whether they are for the 
  whole world like the United Nations or regional like the European Union. These 
  national governments are interested in promoting their own national languages, 
  which is just what they have done. Another factor in such an issue is that even 
  the diplomats from the less powerful countries have their positions because 
  they already have learned the major national languages such as English and French. 
  Are they going to be persuaded to vote to make some other neutral language the 
  official language of the international organization? That would be voting against 
  their own personal interest. A neutral language like Esperanto may be the rational 
  way of dealing with the language problem, but there are no powerful national 
  governments promoting it and there are some interested parties who oppose it.<br>
  <br>
  The issue of teaching Esperanto to all of the children of the world did come 
  up for consideration at the first meeting of the League of Nations in December 
  1920.[xxi] The resolution included the statement that the League of Nations 
  "hopes that this instruction [of Esperanto] will become general in the whole 
  world, in order that children of all nations from now on would know at least 
  two languages, their mother tongue and an easy means of international communication," 
  and it called for the Secretary-General to prepare a detailed report on the 
  results being obtained in teaching Esperanto in various countries.[xxii] France 
  vigorously opposed this resolution on grounds that French was already the universal 
  language.<br>
  <br>
  The next year a new proposal, drafted again by Lord Robert Cecil of South Africa, 
  was presented to the League's Committee on the Agenda. In spite of opposition 
  from France, a report from that committee calling for more study of the teaching 
  of Esperanto was accepted. The Esperantists worked with the Institut J.J. Rousseau 
  in Geneva and the League itself to hold an international conference on the teaching 
  of Esperanto in schools. The language of the conference was Esperanto, and the 
  efficiency with which business was conducted when no interpreters were needed 
  much impressed the observers from the League. The Secretary-General's 1922 "report, 
  Esperanto as an International Auxiliary Language, took a fairly favorable view 
  of Esperanto"[xxiii] but was "careful not to suggest the use of Esperanto as 
  a diplomatic language or in the business of the League itself -- a proposal 
  which would certainly have antagonized the French."[xxiv] Despite some opposition 
  most of the report was accepted, and the specific issue of teaching Esperanto 
  in the schools was referred to the League's Committee on Intellectual Cooperation.[xxv]<br>
  <br>
  The chair of this committee was none other than French philosopher Henri Bergson. 
  Despite the fact that "Bergson had earlier expressed himself in support of Esperanto, 
  he admitted acting under the instructions of B?rard, the then French Minister 
  of Education, to 'drown' Esperanto."[xxvi] In his summary of the committee's 
  deliberations Bergson said that "the invention [Esperanto] would only be desirable 
  if in the long run it imposed itself" and that "from henceforth the business 
  of the League of Nations and of its Committee on Intellectual Cooperation was 
  to encourage the study of living languages, and not that of an artficial language."[xxvii]<br>
  <br>
  In 1923 at the fourth general meeting of the League of Nations France introduced 
  a resolution "recommending the study of foreign languages rather than an artificial 
  one," but this resolution against Esperanto was opposed and eventually withdrawn.[xxviii] 
  In 1924 a new leftist French government adopted a new policy toward Esperanto 
  and "it was resolved unanimously [by the general meeting of the League] to recommend 
  to member states that Esperanto be acceptable as a 'clear' language in telegrams.[xxix] 
  In 1925 the Universal Telegraph Union agreed to accept Esperanto as a clear 
  language, and from 1923 to 1932 the International Labor Office issued a regular 
  bulletin in Esperanto.[xxx]<br>
  <br>
  The Esperantists then began to focus their attention on "technical meetings" 
  where the value of Esperanto would be tied to limited interests such as teaching 
  the language in schools, using it in commerce, using it in radio broadcasting, 
  and using it in science.[xxxi] The Esperanto movement also began to get intertwined 
  with factional struggles in the socialist movement and even a factional struggle 
  within the Nazi movement in Germany. World War II proved to be a disaster for 
  the Esperanto movement, not only because both Stalin and Hitler actively persecuted 
  the Esperantists but also because so much of the fighting and destruction took 
  place in eastern Europe, just that part of the world where the Esperanto movement 
  had been the strongest. Another factor which was very damaging to the Esperanto 
  movement and which has become steadily worse is the influence of English as 
  the language of the politically, economically, scientifically, and technologically 
  powerful United States. The general feeling, even among leaders of non-English-speaking 
  countries, is that the language one needs for international communication is 
  English. Why bother with Esperanto even if UNESCO did pass resolutions in 1954 
  and again in 1985 supporting the teaching of Esperanto?[xxxii]<br>
  <br>
  This situation puts the moral pressure directly on us whose native language 
  is English. The question is, Why should the rest of the world be forced to use 
  the English language for international communication when only a declining 5.7 
  % of the world's population are native speakers of the language, and when only 
  8.4 % of the world's people are able to use the language?[xxxiii] There are 
  three other languages with a larger number of native speakers -- Mandarin Chinese, 
  Hindi, and Spanish. We see here a linguistic imperialism based on the superior 
  military, economic, technological, and political power of the United States. 
  The situation has nothing to do with how good the English language is or how 
  readily it can be learned. Furthermore, this situation of linguistic imperialism 
  is arousing plenty of complaints and demands for language rights throughout 
  the world as people using other languages indicate their concern about how to 
  protect their own languages from the unwanted dominance of English.[xxxiv] There 
  is also the bind in which the less-developed countries are put. They need to 
  use a major language, often the language of their former colonial oppressor, 
  in order to have access to the rest of the world with the result that their 
  already scarce educational resources must be used to teach their children a 
  difficult-to-learn second or third language as well as their national and/or 
  tribal language.[xxxv]<br>
  <br>
  What can be done about the situation? Obviously, one positive reaction would 
  be to become involved with the promotion of Esperanto as a neutral world language 
  which is much easier to learn than English and which is not the threat to other 
  national languages that English is. This is a justice issue as well as a matter 
  of preserving diversity while dealing efficiently with the problem of global 
  communication. We could, and should, begin with ourselves and our own children. 
  We should learn Esperanto so that we can use it at our international meetings 
  such as the World Congress of Philosophy to be held in Boston in 1998 or at 
  meetings of IPPNO. It is inappropriate to raise objections about others engaging 
  in linguistic imperialism while we continue to do so ourselves.<br>
  <br>
  There is an additional argument for teaching Esperanto to our English-speaking 
  children. Our school system in the United States is such that most children 
  are not learning any language other than English. This means that the children 
  in the rest of the world are likely to be having an experience of learning at 
  least one language in addition to their native language while many of our children 
  are not. Esperanto is the perfect way to introduce all of our children to a 
  second language.[xxxvi] My experience in teaching Esperanto to children indicates 
  that fourth or fifth grade is the ideal time to begin. If you do not already 
  know the language, you can learn it along with your children and then use it 
  along with them -- on the internet, reading publications from other countries, 
  corresponding with children in the rest of the world, and even traveling to 
  Esperanto conferences throughout the world. An extra benefit from Esperanto 
  is the sense of identity with the world community that comes with learning a 
  whole-world language rather than just another national language.[xxxvii] There 
  may be other things that we can do to try to promote a just language policy 
  for the world community and to develop a lively sense of being part of that 
  evolving larger planetary community, but there is no reason not to begin with 
  Esperanto for ourselves and our own children and grandchildren.<br>

  in detail in Peter G. Forster, The Esperanto Movement, The Hague: Mouton, 1982, 
  pp. 169-87. This book is also a good source in English for the history of the 
  Esperanto movement from its beginning until the time of its publication as well 
  as having an appendix which provides information about the language itself.<br>

  [xxxii]The Esperanto version of the text of the 1985 UNESCO Resolution IX.4.4.218 
  (8 Nov 1985) can be found in Esperanto, December 1985, p. 203. The English-language 
  version is available from UNESCO, 2 U.N. Plaza, Room 900, New York NY 10017.<br>

  [xxxiii]According to The World Almanac, 1997, p. 642, the number of native speakers 
  of English in mid-1996 was 330 million. According to p. 838 the total population 
  of the world in 1996 was 5,772 million. The requisite division indicates that 
  5.7% of the world's population are native speakers of English. The total number 
  of speakers of English is given as 487 million, which is 8.4 % of the world's 
  total.<br>

  [xxxiv]For example, the May 1997 issue of the Esperanto biweekly publication 
  Eventoj (Events) has a front-page article about "Linguistic Imperialism" from 
  the newsletter of the Norwegian Esperantists, an article which was also published 
  in translated form in a Bulgarian newspaper. As another example, the Canadian 
  Centre for Linguistic Rights at the University of Ottawa has issued a 700-page 
  set of the proceedings of a conference on linguistic rights held in 1995. A 
  review of the proceedings can be found in Esperantic Studies, Spring 1997, in 
  the front-page article "The UN and Language Rights: Reports from the Front Lines" 
  by Mark Fettes. Esperantic Studies is published by the Esperantic Studies Foundation, 
  3900 Northampton St. NW, Washington DC 20015.<br>
