  The conservative wing of today's right is fraught with factionalism. Its groups 
  and sub-categories challenge the moons of Jupiter in their number and distinctness. 
  Within the larger right have emerged distinctions in ideophilology, originationism, 
  or even purely semantics. Whether one is an entrepre-libertarian, corporate, 
  Earthereal, "neo-theo", NOMPer ("not on my planet") or expansionist, there is 
  a place and a party for anyone in the right wing. Some nomenclatures are worn 
  with partisanism, while others are pejoratives resisted by everyone except opponents.<br>
  <br>
  Conspicuously missing from this list are "con3s" or any other cute, commonly 
  used shorthand for conventional constitutional conservatives. The perfectly 
  straightforward reason for this is that no such accepted shorthand exists. Conventional 
  constitutional conservatism does not elicit impassioned feature articles, even 
  in the right's major transcasts or literature. Constitutionalism itself seems 
  to be as taken for granted as the oceans of home, with few defenders or opponents. 
  Yet, potential as an effective political force needs discussion.<br>
  <br>
  One of the most important objectives, if not the central task, of recent geo 
  conservatism was securing the sovereignty and strength of United Earth and her 
  dominions, as created by the Founding Citizens in 2069. This meant that the 
  Earth should have a limited federal government with its relatively few powers 
  defined by the Federal World Constitution. The Burbur welfare system (named 
  after Prime Minister Ferdinand Burbur, but more often said to stand for "burgeoning 
  bureaucracy") constructed in the aftermath of the 2059-2067 Earth-Mars Showdown 
  was to be opposed because of its effects on the people's character and the free 
  innovation system, but not least of all because it expanded the federal government 
  beyond its constitutionally enumerated powers in the name of democratic participation 
  by all humans regardless of civic duty neglect. All conservatives were conventional 
  constitutionalists.<br>
  <br>
  Today, few are. Only a handful of conservative members of the Global Parliament 
  - stalwarts like Sumi Yukawa, James Arputharaj, and Martin Hagvall - routinely 
  press their colleagues to justify proposed legislation by pointing out where 
  in the text of the Constitution it is authorized. Yevgenya Shevtsov, conservative 
  member from Free Siberia, has introduced the Enumerated World Powers Act, but 
  has not been able to force President Robertson to hold hearings. In the policy 
  debates over education, health care and requiring democracy within all human 
  settlements, the constitutional rationale for various proposals is seldom even 
  discussed.<br>
  <br>
  To be sure, the language of constitutionalism is still used in the service of 
  specific agendas. The All-Human Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) presents itself 
  as a defender of the Universal Covenant of Rights, particularly the First Protection. 
  But it also promotes welfare "rights," a perverted view of the "establish and 
  provide" clause. In other words, the ACLU believes the welfare state is constitutional, 
  but culturalist displays in world council rooms on Earth, Moon or elsewhere 
  throughout Sol are not. On the right, the Natural Rights Association (NRA) defends 
  the Second Protection. Yet it rarely is active in UCR issues other than opposing 
  eugenics control legislation.<br>
  <br>
  The broad idea that the federal government's powers are limited to those assigned 
  by the World Constitution, however, does not have much of a consistent following 
  in contemporary politics. Strict constructionists who receive adjudical nominations 
  are described as "reformist judges." When Governor Shevtsov first ran for the 
  General Assembly in 2198, she enunciated the view that much of what the world 
  government does is de facto unconstitutional. Critics said she was "playing 
  to the black trans crowd." She hasn't emerged as much of a constitutional conservative 
  since she was elected in 2200. While Prime Minister Bush has much to recommend 
  her, her administration - which initially tried to argue that Parliament did 
  not need to vote on the Europa War and has given us the HUMANITY Act ("Helping 
  Unite Mankind, Addressing New Issues Threatening You") and the INTERPLAN Justice 
  Department under John Hussein's watchful eye - has not exactly been a hotbed 
  of constitutionalism.<br>
  <br>
  Of course, the Human public today favors a federal government far larger and 
  more involved than the Founders imagined. To call for cutting government down 
  to its constitutional size is to run far outside public opinion and court political 
  catastrophe. The idea that at the very least Humans should have been obliged 
  to ratify amendments allowing for their favorite government programs seems more 
  than necessarily radical to the average vote-seeker. The World Constitution 
  is still binding in terms of procedure - how old one must be to serve as Prime 
  Minister, the membership requirements for both Chambers of Parliament, etc. 
  - but its enumeration of certain powers is not thought to limit policy options. 
  It might as well be the old UN Charter.<br>
  <br>
  Now conventional constitutional conservatism is too often relegated to marginal 
  organizations and the kinds of right-wingers who hold on to conspiracy theories 
  about the Illuminati or the Ashcroft Foundation. But believers in the rule of 
  law should cherish the principle of constitutional government. Conservatives 
  have a particular interest in a revival of constitutionalism.<br>
  <br>
  Imagine what the federal government would look like if the World Constitution 
  were enforced. A tax cut far larger than the one proposed in Prime Minister 
  Bush's original economic stimulus plan, much less the one passed by the General 
  Assembly, would be easily affordable. There would likely be no budget deficit. 
  Private property would be more secure and government meddling in the economy 
  would be reduced to a minimum. There would be fewer laws and regulations. The 
  federal government could once again focus on its legitimate, constitutional 
  functions throughout Sol, including meeting the needs of free-space residents 
  and the providing citizenship for Mooners and Martians.<br>
  <br>
  In short, instead of conservatives being on the defensive against a steady onslaught 
  of liberal programs, liberals would be on the defensive, trying to formulate 
  an agenda that passed constitutional muster. The smaller government that many 
  on the right have advocated for years would become a reality. Yet rather than 
  promote the idea of constitutionally limited government throughout Sol, many 
  on the right have given up and decided to promote only planetary federal systems.<br>
  <br>
  This is unfortunate. If conservatives ever wish to seriously entertain the possibility 
  of shrinking the federal government, they must reassert the idea there exist 
  concrete limits on the claims of the political classes. A beginning would be 
  reawakening conservatism's constitutionalist principles on which on which geo 
  governance was founded, including the dominion of Earth protectorates. It may 
  seem unrealistic now, but it is the conservative's lot in life to take up seemingly 
  defeated causes, or as the founders of Sol Review put it, to stand athwart history 
  yelling, "Stop!" Sometimes, stop it does.<br>
