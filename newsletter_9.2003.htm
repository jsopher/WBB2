  2. WORLD BEYOND BORDERS LAUNCH</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">With this launch of the inaugural 
  issue of our World Beyond Borders Newsletter, we'd like to start by inviting 
  you all into our on-line community. With your help, we hope to grow as an organization 
  and spread a vision for the future that isn't restricted by arbitrary political 
  boundaries of nations and the brutal conflicts created by sustaining them. Now 
  more than ever we are coming to realize that a world beyond borders is the only 
  solution for building a sustainable human civilization in which a global constitution 
  and bill of rights provides liberty and justice for all. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">With our energies no longer consumed 
  by wars and the impossible task of securing one or two continents as impenetrable 
  fortresses of privilege through nuclear superiority, we will be able to build 
  up the kingdom of one humanity and global government to serve us all. In a world 
  of perpetual peace and plenty, imagine our new potential as a transformed civilization, 
  ready to embark on new adventures we can only begin to dream of. We know how 
  idealistic all this sounds but that's what all of us here have in common. We've 
  all caught a vision of the future that takes our breath away and how could we 
  do anything less than pass this gospel on to others? </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This brings us to our next point and 
  that is, utopia is something dwelling inside of us and those who've caught this 
  beautiful vision of our true potential. Now we must all seek to make this internal 
  state an external reality. If each of us becomes this new citizen and vehicle 
  of a united Earth, our ultimate allegiance can never belong to distopian superpowers 
  with their corrupt visions of empire and business as usual through ends that 
  justify the means. Citizenship of a united Earth carries with it the great responsibility 
  of using ends that are preexistent in the means. This implies no more preemptive 
  strikes and weapons of mass destruction to drive others to do our will. The 
  just cause of our movement must rely on moral and spiritual force utilized by 
  ordinary people like you and me. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The social evolution of humanity is 
  a never ending job we've all inherited and can never be completed on our own. 
  As Isaac Newton said over three hundred years ago, "If I have seen a bit further 
  than others, it's because I stand on the shoulders of giants." Let us become 
  the giants that future generations stand over, getting ever closer to our goals 
  than before. Because we are all part of this evolving movement of humanity together, 
  we all can take comfort that we are involved in a process of life and evolution 
  bigger than any one of us. The Cosmos has been set into motion and we are not 
  separate from this flow of matter and energy. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Each of us must be challenged to take 
  this energy the cosmos has provided and use it towards joining together in this 
  goal we share. This can be done through many means and this website is only 
  a small instance of one of them. If you are so moved, we ask that you join us 
  at World Beyond Borders in whatever capacity you can to help us spread our message 
  and work towards the ideals we hold dear. Please join our newsletter today and 
  contribute any of your writing and ideas so that this site can grow as an expression 
  of what we all seek together.</font><font face="Arial" size="4"> </font></p>

  3. <b>DEEP-SEA DUCKS AND NAUTICAL NIKES </b><br>
  <br>
  Why is there a $100 reward for finding a rubber duck washed up along a beach? 
  Because these aren't just any rubber ducks. They are world travelers.<br>
  <br>
  In 1992, a container carrying rubber frogs, turtles, beavers and, yes, ducks 
  made by the company The First Years fell overboard in a storm. For eleven years, 
  the toys have been floating on the currents and now they should be washing up 
  on north Atlantic shores.<br>
  <br>
  Oceanographer Curt Ebbesmeyer has devised models of ocean currents that show 
  that some of the toys, lost in the north Pacific, should slowly make their way 
  through the Arctic and wash up in New England, Iceland, maybe even north Africa. 
  Tracking currents is a challenge for oceanographers and finding the toys will 
  test Ebbesmeyer's models. To that end, The First Years put up money for beachcomber 
  rewards.<br>
  <br>
  The bath toys aren't the first flotsam tracked down by curious oceanographers. 
  In 1990, 80,000 Nikes were lost at sea. When beachcombers began finding the 
  soggy shoes, Ebbesmeyer realized he could use them to study currents.<br>
  <br>
  Of course, toys and shoes are not the only things that get lost at sea. So does 
  oil and toxic waste. Tracking the toys teaches us these spills may end up far 
  from their point of origin.<br>

  4. WHAT YOU CAN DO <br>
  <br>
  *Know a beach buff? Show them the article on lost sneakers and rubber ducks. 
  Better yet, go beachcombing together. Try to guess where the things you find 
  came from and talk about how currents connect the world.<br>
  <br>
  *Forward this email to at least two people. Forward it to your friends, your 
  mom, your boss. (Well, skip your boss if this will tell her you've been doing 
  email on company time again.) Just forward it!<br>
