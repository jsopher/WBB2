  WALL <br>
  <font size="2">by Robert Frost</font></font></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Something there is that doesn't love a wall, <br>
  That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it, <br>
  And spills the upper boulders in the sun; <br>
  And makes gaps even two can pass abreast. <br>
  The work of hunters is another thing: <br>
  I have come after them and made repair <br>
  Where they have left not one stone on stone, <br>
  But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, <br>
  To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean, <br>
  No one has seen them made or heard them made, <br>
  But at spring mending-time we find them there. <br>
  I let my neighbor know beyond the hill; <br>
  And on a day we meet to walk the line <br>
  And set the wall between us once again. <br>
  We keep the wall between us as we go. <br>
  To each the boulders that have fallen to each. <br>
  And some are loaves and some so nearly balls <br>
  We have to use a spell to make them balance: <br>
  "Stay where you are until our backs are turned!" <br>
  We wear our fingers rough with handling them. <br>
  Oh, just another kind of outdoor game, <br>
  One on a side. It comes to little more: <br>
  He is all pine and I am apple-orchard. <br>
  My apple trees will never get across <br>
  And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him. <br>
  He only says, "Good fences make good neighbors." <br>
  Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder <br>
  If I could put a notion in his head: <br>
  "Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it <br>
  Where there are cows? But here there are no cows. <br>
  Before I built a wall I'd ask to know <br>
  What I was walling in or walling out, <br>
  And to whom I was like to give offence. <br>
  Something there is that doesn't love a wall, <br>
  That wants it down!" I could say "Elves" to him, <br>
  But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather <br>
  He said it for himself. I see him there, <br>
  Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top <br>
  In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed. <br>
  He moves in darkness as it seems to me, <br>
  Not of woods only and the shade of trees. <br>
  He will not go behind his father's saying, <br>
  And he likes having thought of it so well <br>
  He says again, "Good fences make good neighbors."</font></p>
