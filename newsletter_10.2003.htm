  1. QUOTE OF THE MONTH<br>
  <br>
  "A federation of all humanity, together with a sufficient measure of social 
  justice, to ensure health, education, and a rough equality of opportunity to 
  most of the children born into the world, would mean such a release and increase 
  of human energy as to open a new phase in human history." --H.G. Wells<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  2. WHAT'S NEW AT WORLD BEYOND BORDERS?<br>
  <br>
  World Beyond Borders has grown tremendously in the past month. We have new articles, 
  new features and new projects and we're eager to tell you about them.<br>
  <br>
  If you've visited our site recently, you've probably seen the new "Make a Donation" 
  buttons. We have no shortage of cool ideas, but it takes money to make some 
  of them happen. Right now, we want to sponsor The Hunger Site. If you've never 
  visited The Hunger Site (www.hungersite.com), it's a click-to-donate website 
  where you click a button and sponsors pay for food for the hungry. America's 
  Second Harvest and Mercy Corps distribute the food. Why not go over there now 
  and click?<br>
  <br>
  Are you back? Did you see those sponsor advertisements? Well, we want to have 
  a World Beyond Borders ad up there so it will reach caring, globally minded 
  folks like you. And all of the money goes to buy food for people who really 
  need it. <br>
  <br>
  If you normally give money to groups fighting hunger, why not donate to World 
  Beyond Borders this month instead? We use PayPal, so everything is secure. If 
  you want your whole donation to go to sponsoring The Hunger Site, say so when 
  you fill out the donation form. Otherwise, we may keep up to $10 for future 
  projects. Thank you!<br>
  <br>
  OK, so what else is going on? We've added two discussion boards to the Interactive 
  Activities and Communication section. One is for debating the pros and cons 
  of global government and the other is for general talk. So go over there and 
  meet some of your fellow world citizens!<br>
  <br>
  We're sponsoring a contest to design a flag and anthem for planet Earth. The 
  contest page is in the "Interactive Activities and Communication" section. We 
  have printable PDF flyers you can distribute. And please consider entering yourself.<br>
  <br>
  We also have a bunch of new articles. Here they are, by section.<br>
  <br>
  Why Global Government?<br>
  <b>&#149;</b> "Petitioning a Government That Does Not Yet Exist" by Beth Sawin 
  looks at those fake UN anti-war petitions you all got a few months ago. People 
  are realizing that the Earth is deeply interconnected and, Sawin writes, "More 
  and more of us are going to be turning to something that we have yet to create 
  - a government that can hear all of us, all of the people of a world that is 
  whole."<br>
  <b>&#149;</b> "Confessions of a Passionate World Citizen" by Jane Shevtsov reflects 
  on what it means to live as a global citizen. Where does a belief that humanity 
  is more than the sum of its 6.3 billion parts take you in the present world? 
  This piece has more questions than answers and we hope you'll share your thoughts 
  on our discussion board.<br>
  <br>
  How Might We Get There?<br>
  <b>&#149;</b> "To Sear the Collective Soul: The Big Vision and Why We Should 
  Talk About It" by Tad Daley is both a discussion of strategy and a beautifully 
  written, inspirational view of the Big Vision of democratic global government 
  and a united Earth. Highly recommended.<br>
  <b>&#149;</b> Ronald Glossop has contributed two articles on (but not in) Esperanto. 
  "Why We Should All Learn Esperanto" is pretty much what its title says. "Why 
  We All Should Be Esperantists" takes a more academic look at some political 
  and historical aspects of Esperanto. Hey, it's worth a try!<br>
  <b>&#149;</b> "Leaders, Celebrities, Organizations Call for World Government"... 
  or do they? <br>
  <br>
  That's all until next month. Please send article submissions to Jane Shevtsov, 
  jaia@ucla.edu.<br>

  3. UTOPIA BEYOND BORDERS<br>
  by Eli Williamson-Jones<br>
  <br>
  One of the most powerful forces that has shaped human social evolution for thousands 
  of years is the utopian drive. Everyone seeks to find seemingly perfect conditions 
  in which they can thrive and live out their existence in happiness. The places 
  in our world where obstacles inhibit or deny this drive are the places with 
  the most brutal conflicts and intense human suffering. The recent headlines 
  of our news attest to this reality in the Middle East, where Palestinians will 
  go so far as to blow themselves up with their enemies in the cause of restoring 
  their old way of life and the freedoms now denied them. <br>
  <br>
  "Utopian" and "utopianism" are words associated with impossibly idealistic, 
  visionary reform. It may be impossible to have a perfect world but it is also 
  impossible to keep people from trying to build one. America can be seen as one 
  of the largest products of this evolutionary force and as the largest and longest-lasting 
  utopian bubble humanity has ever built. Behind it, we can see a past succession 
  of lesser utopian bubbles from the British to the Roman Empire, all the way 
  back to the lavish lives of the emperors of China and kings of ancient Egypt. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The life span of a utopian bubble is usually short because it is often built 
  on the oppression and exploitation of vast numbers of individuals. We have yet 
  to figure out a way to build a sustainable utopia that isn't exclusive and constructed 
  on the misfortune of others, creating enemies and provoking attacks by them. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Although we have a ways to go before we build a sustainable civilization, most 
  believe they can buy a taste of utopia if they have enough money. We know that 
  money may not buy us happiness, but most believe it can pull their yacht right 
  up next to it. There is a utopian magazine called Architectural Digest that 
  provides great examples of this utopian drive at work in the world. It is filled 
  with pictures and accounts of those who have attempted to create their own personal 
  utopia. Every article in this magazine examines a bubble utopia, with its near 
  perfect world or attempt at building one within a mundane, incoherent, or distopian 
  setting. <br>
  <br>
  To many people, the articles and advertisements in this magazine appear unreal 
  because we seldom see such a perfect reality with unblemished humans, objects 
  and environments. But if one enters the world of absolute excess, the playgrounds 
  of millionaires and billionaires, one will find their efforts and vast resources 
  being channeled towards this goal of building and sustaining personal utopias. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The science of the utopian drive is something that filmmakers and screenwriters 
  have tapped into to boost their revenues and ensure a successful movie. Their 
  utopian equation is expressed through mythological structure with the hero as 
  a representative or citizen of utopia or guardian of a utopian bubble. Evil 
  or distopia exists as those who attack utopias from the outside or corrupt them 
  from within. Audiences will pay a lot of money to escape the distopian setting 
  of their lives and feed their hunger for utopia. That's why during the distopian 
  times of the Great Depression, the film industry did extraordinarily well. <br>
  <br>
  If we look at the top ten highest grossing movies of all time, we see the utopian 
  equation at work in each of them. The utopian heroes are the "good guys" and 
  represent citizens of utopia. In The Lord of the Rings, the Hobbits exist in 
  a utopian setting of the Shire, with its plentiful sustenance and high standard 
  of living for all. It is here that the hero, Frodo, takes up his hero's journey 
  to protect his world and way of life. In Star Wars, the Rebellion is made up 
  of heroes fighting for a utopian future, free from the bondage and tyranny of 
  the distopian Empire. Lord of the Rings and Star Wars occupy four out of the 
  top ten spaces below. <br>
  <br>
  1. Titanic - $1,835,300,000 worldwide sales (utopian heroes trying to escape 
  a doomed utopia bubble) <br>
  <br>
  2. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - $968,600,000 worldwide sales (utopian 
  heroes fighting distopian threats) <br>
  <br>
  3. Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace - $922,300,000 worldwide sales (utopian 
  heroes fighting distopian threats) <br>
  <br>
  4. Jurassic Park - $919,700,000 worldwide sales (utopian heroes narrowly escaping 
  a utopian tragedy) <br>
  <br>
  5. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - $918,600,000 worldwide sales (utopian 
  heroes fighting distopian threats) <br>
  <br>
  6. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets $866,300,000 worldwide sales (utopian 
  heroes fighting distopian threats) <br>
  <br>
  7. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring $860,200,000 worldwide sales 
  (utopian heroes fighting distopian threats) <br>
  <br>
  8. Independence Day - $811,200,000 worldwide sales (utopian heroes fighting 
  distopian threats) <br>
  <br>
  9. Spider-Man $806,700,000 worldwide sales (utopian heroes fighting distopian 
  threats) <br>
  <br>
  10. Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope - $797,900,000 worldwide sales (utopian 
  heroes fighting distopian threats)<br>
  </font></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
  Aside from the film industry, countless others use visions of utopia to boost 
  their sales. The advertisement industry, which uses utopian imagery to attract 
  us and make us purchase products, is one of them. Ads make people believe they 
  can experience a bit of utopia in their lives. Other industries are entirely 
  devoted to protecting utopian bubbles from outside threats. One large-scale 
  manifestation of these efforts in the real world can be found in the trillion 
  dollar security industry that surfaces in everything from home security systems 
  and guns to the military-industrial complex with missile defense and weapons 
  of mass destruction. All these resources are poured into the efforts of protecting 
  utopian bubbles from distopian threats. <br>
  <br>
  Now the question we must ask ourselves is, where will this utopian drive within 
  lead us? Our energies may be directed towards building a personal utopian bubble 
  like in Architectural Digest. Perhaps a beautiful million dollar mansion in 
  the country with brilliant interior decorating and hanging gardens outside. 
  Maybe our energy is directed towards saving money for a utopian car or wardrobe. 
  Or perhaps we use our resources for plastic surgery to make ourselves look more 
  utopian and more likely to attract that utopian man or woman of our dreams. 
  The applications of this utopian drive is limited only by our determination 
  and the obstacles keeping us from tasting success. <br>
  <br>
  There is one important thing to consider before we run off and continue with 
  business as usual and our everyday pursuit of utopia. We must become aware of 
  the places in the world where the people have been completely shut off from 
  any possibility of utopian fulfillment. There are nations on Earth whose citizens 
  live hand to mouth and have no way to rise above the distopian nightmares of 
  poverty, civil war and endemic diseases running rampant. It is places like these 
  where terrorists are most likely to be raised and taught to hate and attack 
  the utopian bubbles of the West that control 65% of the world's resources, yet 
  have only 14% of the population. <br>
  <br>
  Perhaps we should direct some of our utopian drive towards trying to start plans 
  and construction on a utopia that encompasses the whole Earth, and not just 
  an elite percentage of the population. How practical is it to keep building 
  utopian bubbles if they are constantly inciting individuals to destroy them? 
  How practical is it to try to live with business as usual in a nation hated 
  by the distopian Al-Qaeda that will stop at nothing to arm themselves with nuclear 
  weapons and sacrifice their lives in the cause of bursting our utopian bubbles? 
  <br>
  <br>
  America is a utopian bubble in danger of popping precisely because it is failing 
  to take into account the utopian drives and aspirations held by the other two 
  billion people on the planet, living on $2 or less a day. As long as this cavernous 
  gap between utopia and distopia grows wider, dualistic polar energies will continue 
  to incite terrorists to attack our utopian bubbles, just as they did on September 
  11, 2001. <br>
  <br>
  We must use our utopian drives and extend them further than the traditionally 
  limited scope of individual, family, and nation to encompass a sustainable civilization 
  of all humanity. The world will never achieve the Utopian ideal of liberty and 
  justice for all unless the world's citizens unite and embrace a Constitution 
  for all peoples of planet Earth. If we recognize this next needed step in our 
  evolution, we are potential citizens of the united world or Omega Utopia. This 
  is a civilization that has reached homeostasis and is no longer in danger of 
  self-destructing through fragmented parts waging war on each other. <br>
  <br>
  Although we don't live in this world yet, we can see what must be done to get 
  us to our destination. A global utopia would have few enemies among us and the 
  only real threats we would face would come from distopian extra-terrestrials 
  who have yet to reveal themselves. Until we work towards these ends, we will 
  continue to sustain a world of imbalance and suffering whose correction will 
  come in the horrendous form of World War III. To the burned and mutilated survivors 
  of this nightmare nuclear holocaust will come the great sorrow and realization 
  that we could have prevented it, but did not. <br>

  4. WHAT YOU CAN DO<br>
  <br>
  *Forward this email to at least two people. Yes, we asked you to do that last 
  time, but email is a free and effective way to spread the word about World Beyond 
  Borders, so we are asking you again.<br>
  <br>
  *Support our flag and anthem contests. Enter yourself. Get kids at a local school 
  or library to create designs. Put up flyers where they'll be noticed. Translate 
  the flyers into other languages and send them to us. Send contest info around 
  by email. We welcome your energy and creativity.<br>
  <br>
  *Give money for our Hunger Site ad. Yes, there's probably no shortage of groups 
  asking for your hard-earned cash, but here your donation will do good twice 
  -- first by promoting the vision of a world beyond borders and then by feeding 
  hungry people around the world. Thanks in advance!<br>
