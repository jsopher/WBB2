The New Federalist seeks to fill a growing need resulting from the rapid rise of the movement for international federal union, whether on an Atlantic, a European, or a world scale. It aims to clarify basic federal principles, to distinguish a federal democracy from a unified democracy and from a league or alliance, to call attention to neglected features of federalism which events have made important now. In short, its authors have sought to think out afresh basic federal principles and to apply them in the light of modern needs, between nations.<br>
<br>
Though they themselves favor the Atlantic Union approach to the world federal problem, they hope their concise clarification of federal principles will be of value to all who are interested in any plan for international federation, or who would understand the essentials of existing federal governments, such as those of the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Australia, South Africa. Its authors hope it may also be of value in Asia, where the constitutions of India and of the United States of Indonesia testify to the worldwide trend toward federalism.<br>
<br>
The New Federalist draws its inspiration, of course, from the classic Federalist. The present book seeks, however, to cultivate new ground. Thus, where The Federalist sought to apply federal principles between the thirteen states, The New Federalist would apply them between nations. Again, where The Federalist aimed to secure ratification of the draft United States Constitution by explaining all its provisions, The New Federalist aims to help get an international federal constitution drafted. To this end it seeks to bring out the basic principles in existing constitutions that distinguish federal union from other forms of political organization and that are therefore most essential in any further application of federalism.<br>
<br>
Because the United States Constitution was the first one made on a full federal union basis, many who favor international federation today cite it as a model to be followed. This leads others to conclude that all its major provisions must be copied internationally. The New Federalist serves to remove the confusion in this regard by separating the features in the U.S. Constitution that are truly federal from those which are also to be found in nonfederal governments.<br>
<br>
Like the Federalist papers, the New Federalist articles first appeared in the periodical press. They were published monthly in the magazine Freedom & Union, of Washington, D.C., between October 1946 and February 1949. The Federalist papers appeared over the signature of Publius, though some were written by John Jay, more by James Madison, and most by Alexander Hamilton. To acknowledge their debt to these men, the authors of The New Federalist signed them Publius II in the magazine. Some of these papers were written by Owen J. Roberts, former Justice of the United States Supreme Court, others by John F. Schmidt, a patent attorney whose avocation is the study of federal union, and the rest by me.<br>
<br>
It may seem presumptuous that anyone should attempt to carry forward so enshrined a masterpiece as The Federalist, but it was in no such spirit that we acted. We thought it better to risk comparisons that could only bring out our own shortcomings than to risk seeing the great principles of The Federalist give way to tyranny or anarchy through continued failure to try to carry them further in our time. And if our little book shall serve only to send readers back to studying the classic that has been all too long neglected, we shall be happy, no matter how our pages pale beside it.<br>

<br>
<b>I. On Our Purpose</b><br>
Thanks primarily to the English, American and French Revolutions there now exists not only a number of free representative governments but also a number of free federal unions. And thanks to the scientific and mechanical development that these political advances have fostered, all the nations of the world are nearer to each other, in travel and in missile time, than were the thirteen states when they formed the first federal union.<br>
<br>
The task of our generation is to extend to a larger area the basic federal union principles that have already stood the test of time, rather than invent new machinery. This is no easy task.<br>
<br>
The thirteen colonies stood out separately from London like spokes without a rim, but they did have a hub. Their governments were quite independent of each other, but in 1787 none was even two hundred years old, and none had ever made war on another.<br>
<br>
To unite in federal union by free agreement merely two nations of the same language that have warred against each other, even a century ago, is clearly a formidable undertaking. It is easy only when compared to the task of federating forty, fifty or sixty year old established nations that have never been united even by a common hub, and whose people have tried to kill each other recently, and time and again. Yet freedom and peace depend on our succeeding now in this task of extending between at least some nations the principles of federal union, of beginning at least the nucleus of a world republic. To this problem we address ourselves.<br>
<br>
We shall leave it to others to demonstrate the necessity and utility of making this next step in federal union. We propose to elucidate briefly the basic principles of federal union, and distinguish between the primary and the secondary in them. We mean to bring out the essential differences between a federal union and a bloc, alliance, league or confederation on the one hand, and a nation or empire on the other, and show why federal union works where the others fail. We propose to deal also with such practical and tightly interrelated problems of international federation as where and how to begin--with what peoples as founders, with what federal powers, with what type of federal structure.<br>
<br>
<b>II. Basic Federal Principle</b><br>
Winston Churchill won, in June, 1940, the distinction of being the first head of a great power government--Britain--to propose a union with another power --France. In a speech at Zurich, he proposed a European union whose main pillars would be France and Germany, with Britain apparently a benevolent outsider.<br>
<br>
Mr. Churchill said repeatedly that what he was proposing was "a United States of Europe." He identified it the more with the United States of America and a true federal system by also calling it a "union."<br>
<br>
But then Mr. Churchill used "regional structure" and "European grouping" to describe what he proposed. Still more indicative of the apparent confusion in his mind of blocs and leagues with the federal system and the United States was this statement: "The League of Nations did not fail because of its principles or conceptions. It failed because these principles were deserted by those states who had brought it into being."<br>
<br>
This is one of error's hardy perennials. If the League's principles were sound, then it would follow that the proposed United States of Europe might as well be built on them as on federal principles. If it is true that Geneva's principles could have worked among all the nations of the world, who had never united on anything, they would surely also work in the United States of America if the people of its forty-eight states --who have lived together all their lives, speak the same language, have the same political concepts and many other common bonds--were to replace their federal Constitution tomorrow with the League Covenant. But would Mr. Churchill follow his thought through to this, its logical conclusion?<br>
<br>
The confusion that Mr. Churchill's use of terms typifies is so widespread and dangerous that the essential difference between a federal union and a league, alliance or bloc needs to be highlighted. The latter differ from federal union as black from white. The easiest way to distinguish between the two is through their basic units. There are only two such units that can be used in organizing international society: an existing political body, the nation, taken as a whole, or the human beings who compose it, taken as individuals.<br>
<br>
The way that takes the nation as the sovereign unit treats it as if it were itself a person, with the government its head and the citizens mere cells in its body. To start on this basis is to end by giving each nation, regardless of the size of its population, one vote, to be cast by its government--the citizen having little more to say about it than a cell in his toe has to say about his own decisions.<br>
<br>
You end, too, 1) by subordinating the freedom of the citizen to the freedom or sovereignty of the nation, whose maintenance thus becomes the supreme purpose of your international organization; 2) by finding that the smallest possible conflict that your organization can face is a conflict between armed nations, with the weakest possible violator of its rules an armed nation.<br>
<br>
You do not get a government, a union, a federation, a federal republic, or anything remotely resembling the United States of America. You get instead an entente, a "fraternal association," an alliance, a coalition, a bloc, a grouping, a league such as the Wilsonian one or the United Nations. You get a system that has been tried time and again, but has always failed to keep the peace within its jurisdiction or secure human freedom and prosperity.<br>
<br>
Consider what inevitably follows when you take individual man, instead, for the unit of your international society.<br>
<br>
All the laws of the government you form operate on the citizen directly. That means that you have reduced the conflicts in your international society to conflicts in which individual persons, rather than any body they may represent, are the essential responsible elements. It gives us as time-tested a guarantee that it can keep the peace among the people of its member nations as the United States gives that it can keep the peace among the people of the 48 states.<br>
<br>
True, there is still the possibility of civil wars. But whereas the United States has suffered one civil war in 161 years, it has eliminated entirely the kind of war between two member states which brought down the Geneva League in the Japan-China, Italy-Ethiopia series, and which has been the curse of every system that took the state as unit. Its civil war decided once for all that the basic difference between a federal union and a league is the one we are stressing here: that its unit is the citizen, not the states.<br>
<br>
<b>III. Sovereignty</b><br>
A confusion, like that between the terms union and league, grows out of the use of the term sovereignty when we speak of cooperation on a plane above the national level. The word sovereign has an appealing sound. When you and I call our nation sovereign, we seem to swell up and take on a superior dignity. That is gratifying, no doubt. But we ought to analyze what we say. We ought to try to see just what we mean when we claim sovereignty as the essence of statehood.<br>
<br>
The use of the term to mark the quality of a state has no basis in history. In the common speech of the past, a sovereign is a monarch. He makes and enforces the rules for men's conduct in his kingdom. By a derivative use of the word, we sometimes call a nation a sovereign. Britain once held mastery of the seas and we spoke of her as queen or sovereign of the seas.<br>
<br>
But in our day we mean no such thing when we speak of a nation as sovereign. We mean that a nation has independent power; that no man or nation may make a rule for its conduct. This use of the term came naturally from the quality of the person who asserts sovereignty over his subjects. Since we assume his power is absolute, we must concede that no king of any other nation can rule his acts. Kings then, by virtue of their sovereignty, cannot be subject to a higher law; they can act jointly only by agreement; and their agreements are not to be enforced by any superior power.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, democratic states are the fruit of a creed that denies to any man or group of men the right to rule the conduct of others. They spring from the belief that all men are equal in political status.<br>
<br>
Men express this belief by the phrases, "sovereignty resides in the people"; "every citizen is a sovereign"; "government must rest on the consent of the governed." So in a democracy we have no sovereign who is independent of the citizens. Through our chosen agents, we collectively act as a government. This is "government of the people, by the people, for the people."<br>
<br>
No government of this sort has existed to regulate the common interests of the men of different nations because we have carried over into the relations of nations the concept of absolute monarchy. Though we are a democracy, we have arrogated to ourselves collectively as a nation the independence of an absolute monarch. As no subject of the king and no subject of any other king can control the royal will, so, we say, no other nation can limit our national will.<br>
<br>
Here emerges the error we note in present-day talk about uniting nations for prevention of war. Men say we can attain joint national action only if each nation will surrender some of its sovereignty. But how can a nation surrender part of its sovereignty? If every state is sovereign, it can recall or ignore its plighted word at will. Take our own case. Our agents in the Congress may alter or annul their ratification of the United Nations Charter at any time. So it is with each U.N. member. If a state is truly sovereign, it cannot effectively surrender its essential nature. The ideas of sovereignty and irrevocable surrender of the right to act contrary to a treaty or contract contradict each other.<br>
<br>
Also, if we are right that sovereignty in our political scheme rests in the citizen alone, the United States as an entity cannot give up a part of its sovereignty. This, because it has none to give; the people have all of it. For the sake of internal order and national security, they exercise it through their own agents--the members of Congress. But those agents have no power they can confer on others. They must employ the powers given them. They cannot redelegate those powers.<br>
<br>
In the light of these facts let us examine the structure of the United Nations. We can appreciate the obstacle the delegates at San Francisco faced. They were bound by the tradition of state sovereignty. They had an impossible task. That was to tie together the peoples of separate states, yet to keep intact the sovereignty of the states to which those people belonged. What was the result? A league--a multi-party treaty--that all member states ratified. Thus we have an alliance of sovereign states, not a union of people.<br>
<br>
But what difference does that make? All the difference between anarchy and government. No agency formed by sovereign states can make rules--laws--for those states or for their citizens. In contrast, a government made up of the agents of the citizens themselves can make rules that bind its citizens and can provide the means to enforce the rules.<br>
<br>
If democracies are to be united for action in behalf of the citizens of all of them as one group, the act of union must be the act of the citizens of all. As we have seen, a democratic government has no sovereignty to give up. Only its members can delegate their sovereign power to their chosen agent. Such delegation is not surrender of anything. It is an exercise of the sovereignty, the power, that rests in the individual. It is confined to the agent to be used as the citizens direct.<br>
<br>
How then are we to have order in the international field? How can we secure the reign of one law over all the people of several nations? Only if they, the people, freely endow an agency of their own with the function of making the rules and the power to enforce the rules. These, as we have seen, are uses of the sovereignty that abides in men, not in the state.<br>
