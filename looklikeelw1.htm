  Wait a minute! You're talking like this future is as certain as the sun rising 
  tomorrow morning. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#6666CC">Eli:</font></b> 
  Let's just say that it's far more likely living in this united world than it 
  is living in in the one we have today. Can you imagine how absurd it would sound 
  if I told you 150 years from now that the same U.N. Security Council will still 
  be governed by the five winners of the Second World War? Or imagine another 
  150 years of arms races where even Guatemala acquires nuclear weapons. Another 
  century of continued balances of power or preemptive strikes against the nations 
  ruled by Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's great grandchildren would be ludicrous. 
  This sounds much more implausible than the completion of the next several steps 
  in our social evolution. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#336633">Lars:</font></b> 
  Hold it! Not only do you sound sure that we won't blow ourselves to bits in 
  the next 150 years but you also speak of this coming one world as if it's part 
  of our evolution. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#6666CC">Eli:</font></b> 
  At a young age, I once attended a religious school where we were taught the 
  world would be destroyed if it wasn't for divine help. Humanity was considered 
  too corrupt to avoid self-destruction, so folks in my church had hope that Jesus 
  would eventually come back and save us. Although I don't share their sense of 
  hopelessness in human affairs, I can see where they were coming from. It's easy 
  to feel pessimistic about humanity when you turn on the news and see all the 
  escalating conflicts and environmental problems in the world. There are reasons 
  to be optimistic though, especially with the birth of the internet. In the first 
  time in our history we can instantaneously unite like-minded people at great 
  distances all over the globe and combat ignorance like never before.
  If you are a student of history, it isn't difficult to see our growth and that 
  this natural progression of our past and present is leading us towards the coming 
  one world. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#336633">Lars:</font></b> 
  What about all the folks who only think of evil when they hear the words "world 
  government"? </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#6666CC">Eli:</font></b> 
  There is always resistance along the way for any social movement. Look how difficult 
  it was for the notion of a round earth to eventually overcome the belief of 
  a flat one. We have come to a point in history where we can clearly see there 
  is no turning back. Once people are confronted with truth, the days for the 
  old way of thinking are numbered. A good example is how in the 1960's, millions 
  of people around the world were confronted with the reality of our world beyond 
  borders in seeing the famous photo of Earth from space. Since then, millions of 
  people have begun to see the dangers of nationalism while embracing a more humane 
  planetary patriotism. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#336633">Lars:</font></b> 
  You've got to admit though that there is a huge gulf between the way things 
  are now and your utopian fantasy. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#6666CC">Eli:</font></b> 
  As Victor Hugo once said, "No army can withstand the strength of an idea 
  who's time has come." Global government is just such an idea whose time 
  draws near. This is really the story of every other major social leap within 
  our history. If you went back in time to the 19th century and tried to tell 
  the racist power elite in America that women would soon be granted the right 
  to vote and slaves given their freedom, they'd probably laugh in your face. 
  Or imagine telling an early colonist that the state they lived in would soon 
  join with many others to form a great nation spanning from the Atlantic to the 
  Pacific Ocean. Seeing how movements take time to progress and form a critical 
  mass, it becomes more understandable how people today can find it hard to imagine 
  all the nations of the world joining together and forming a world federation. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#336633">Lars:</font></b> 
  You have to admit, if it ever happens it's going to be one big bloody mess like 
  the American Civil War but on a larger global scale. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#6666CC">Eli:</font></b> 
  Actually, violence in this case will hurt rather than help the cause. But this 
  discussion should be reserved for the <a href="howwemight.htm">How We Might 
  Get There</a> section. What we want to focus on here is what it might look like. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#336633">Lars:</font></b> 
  Then why don't you tell me. What would a united world look like? </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#6666CC"><b>Eli:</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
  First let's take a look at what many world federalists consider as the closest 
  model available for a united world -- the United States of America. Few would 
  argue with the assertion that the 20th century will be remembered in history 
  books as the American Century. In the course of a hundred years, the United 
  States has made incredible contributions in every category of human advancement. 
  Whether it was in art, medicine, agriculture, or space exploration, all these 
  explosions in creativity are great examples of what can happen when war between 
  a vast community of people is outlawed while they also agree to work together 
  for a sufficient measure of social justice to insure health, education and a 
  rough equality of opportunity for their population. Astronaut Kathryn Sullivan 
  said, "For 225 years, we've been the one place on earth where you can get a 
  taste of what life might be like if the things people have in common mattered 
  more than the things that make them different; if people lived without lines." 
  When this happens you get such a release of energy and an explosion of creativity 
  that you see a glimpse into what humanity is truly capable of. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#336633">Lars:</font></b> 
  Yeah, but what about the negative side of America? All our consumerism, military 
  excess and environmental recklessness? </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#6666CC"><b>Eli:</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
  There is a dark side to America we can't deny but the good that has come out 
  of this democratic experiment is an excellent preview of the next great leap 
  in our social evolution. We must also see that much of America's dark side has 
  come about through our enemies and threats of war with them. Think how much 
  of our nation's energies have been committed to creating weapons and fighting 
  real and theoretical wars against outside threats. Can you imagine how different 
  the state of California would be today if in its past, it had fought several 
  modern wars against Nevada and Arizona while being engaged with Oregon in a 
  nuclear arms race? It certainly wouldn't have the prosperity it has enjoyed 
  in the last fifty years or the creative explosion of art that has entertained 
  the world for over a century. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#336633">Lars:</font></b> 
  So what you're saying is that when you don't have to fight enemies, it frees 
  up most of your energy for constructive activities. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#6666CC"><b>Eli:</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
  Exactly! Take a look at Afghanistan under the rule of the Taliban. The shape 
  that their society was in will clearly show the effects that decades of perpetual 
  war have on a population. Now if you can imagine a world stage where all the 
  nations become states in a united global society of perpetual peace, a new human 
  Renaissance would flourish on Earth. It would feel something like how Martin 
  Luther King Jr. envisioned in his I Have a Dream Speech, "Free at last! 
  free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!" </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#336633">Lars:</font></b> 
  You're a dreamer! </font></p>
