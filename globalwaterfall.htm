<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">How we might go about building a world 
  beyond borders is very difficult for any human to imagine. There may be more 
  connections in our brain than all the stars in the entire cosmos, but this still 
  doesn't help us even scratch the surface of completely understanding ourselves 
  and a world of dizzying complexity, let alone figure out how we are going to 
  unite humanity.<br>
  <br>
  Some of us may see the big picture but most of us can only concentrate our energies 
  towards trying to master limited parts of the whole. One of us may be an expert 
  on psychology or sociology. Another may be an expert in physics, biology, or 
  neurology. Some of those more gifted among us may be renaissance human beings 
  like a Leonardo Da Vinci or Ben Franklin. They become experts in multiple fields, 
  which lets them build a more coherent systems view of the bigger picture.<br>
  <br>
  But even if we are renaissance human beings, we will still have limited knowledge 
  of the world. Because of the limited nature of being human, we'll always carry 
  fragmented parts of the whole that can only become clearer when we come together 
  and combine what we know and have learned together. When this happens, we can 
  begin to move mountains.<br>
  <br>
  Taking a tour of the assembly plant of a modern jet fighter reveals thousands 
  of specialists working together to build a miraculous machine that could never 
  be created by any one individual on their own, even if they had all the time 
  in the world to do so. Building a world beyond borders will be a similar exercise 
  in human cooperation. It will be a movement initiated and carried out by millions 
  upon millions of human beings, all specialists in their particular field of 
  expertise, working towards a more wholistic way of living and governing ourselves.<br>
  <br>
  As an individual writing this article and imagining this potential, it is easy 
  for me to feel small and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. If I suddenly 
  died tomorrow, would it make any difference to the completion and execution 
  of humanity's greatest potential? Probably not, but it may slow it down a bit 
  if we are no longer engaged in helping others and contributing all our talents 
  and energy towards this endeavor.<br>
  <br>
  As individuals, we are small parts of our planet's evolutionary journey. We 
  are connected enough to the whole that we feel elation and joy in the triumphs 
  of our kind, but none of us are significant enough to satisfy egotistical fantasies 
  or longings of becoming a savior to humankind. Similarly, if a drop of water 
  was alive, it could feel joy along with value in being part of a waterfall, 
  but it could never take full credit for its power and majesty.<br>
  <br>
  In the same way, if any one of us are out of the picture, the waterfall of life 
  will continue as it always has, but we will miss out on a fantastic ride. This 
  analogy brings another point to our attention: the collective consciousness 
  of the waterfall can't even take full credit for its own splendor. Through the 
  hard work of gravity, the water crashes down the side of the mountain while 
  the sun illuminates its crystal clear beauty and shines a fantastic rainbow-studded 
  jewel of light through its mists.<br>
  <br>
  There is a danger when the collective consciousness of humanity thinks that 
  we can take full credit for our civilization's triumphs. In many ways we are 
  simply putty to evolutionary forces shaping and controlling our ultimate destiny. 
  This then begs the question, if we can't take full credit for ourselves and 
  how far we've come, do we have any free will or any measure of control over 
  our lives whatsoever?<br>
  <br>
  Most of us would probably argue for the existence of free will or at least the 
  illusion thereof. Two paths lie in front of us and it is our hope we can choose 
  or have the most desirable one chosen for us. It's crazy to think we're doomed, 
  like some believe, destined to promptly end our existence with a 40,000-strong 
  stockpiled arsenal of nuclear weapons.<br>
  <br>
  The absence of freedom has often driven humans to suicide and other acts of 
  desperation. As a civilization, we need to believe in and pursue free will with 
  all our determination because it would be tragic if it was there for us all 
  along but the suicidal hole humanity is digging for itself, pushes us over the 
  brink. But if drastic action is taken, perhaps World War III isn't as inevitable 
  as it seems.<br>
  <br>
  And perhaps we aren't as insignificant as we sometimes feel. Even a waterfall 
  must begin with the first drop. Our efforts to raise the awareness of those 
  around us can open their eyes to our potential and what we must do to successively 
  reach it.</font><br>
