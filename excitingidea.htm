<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">My generation of people 
  in their teens and twenties has grown up with an implicit internationalism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"> Since preschool, we have been 
  learning about the damage people are doing to the Earth. Many of us are concerned 
  enough about sweatshops in developing countries to avoid buying clothes we know 
  are made there. Members of the Chicano student group MEChA wear t-shirts saying, 
  "We didn't cross the borders. The borders crossed us." My own fifth-grade class 
  learned to sing "We Are the World" for the school's winter pageant. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">In "The Declaration of Independence 
  of Cyberspace," John Perry Barlow referred to the Internet as "a world that 
  all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, 
  military force, or station of birth." Many of us came of age in that world. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The global environmental crisis 
  facing humanity reveals our interconnectedness. Burning rainforest in Brazil 
  causes ice at the North Pole to melt. Pollution from China's coal-burning power 
  plants blows over to Southern California. U.S. chemical companies sell pesticides 
  long banned in the United States to developing nations and the toxins return 
  home on imported produce. On a more positive note, environmental groups like 
  Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund work all over the world, and thousands 
  of smaller local organizations now network using the Internet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Where are all these trends, positive 
  and negative, leading us? What do we do about growing global corporate power 
  and the nuclear weapons stockpiles that still threaten us all? How do we react 
  to the rise of nearly instantaneous communication and to those stirring images 
  of the Earth against the cold blackness of space? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">One response is world federalism 
  - an exciting idea with an enormously dull name. I prefer to think of it as 
  an acknowledgement of global citizenship and loyalty to all of humanity. World 
  federalists believe we need a system of democratic global governance on top 
  of (not instead of) national governments. Such a system would provide enforceable 
  legal mechanisms for resolving conflicts, protecting human rights and safeguarding 
  the environment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The current United Nations can 
  provide a base for this kind of world state, but only with many changes. A crucial 
  change would be switching from one-nation-one-vote to a voting system based 
  on population, so that a country with a population of one million does not have 
  the same voting power as one with a billion. Methods of global law enforcement 
  will also have to be developed. To learn more about the changes that will have 
  to be made, check out the web sites of the <a href="http://www.wfa.org">World 
  Federalist Association</a> and <a href="http://www.worldfederalist.org">World 
  Federalist Movement</a>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Perhaps the most exciting aspect 
  of the world federalist vision is the prospect of eliminating war. Just as California 
  does not need to defend itself from Nevada, the countries making up a world 
  state would not need weapons and armies to protect themselves from each other. 
  Right now, the world impoverishes itself, spending almost a trillion dollars 
  each year on ways to kill people. Just think of what could be accomplished if 
  that money was available for peaceful ends! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Can world federalism possibly succeed? 
  According to Paul H. Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson, authors of <i>The Cultural 
  Creatives</i>, the social movements that succeed in the long run are those that 
  challenge cultural assumptions and reframe issues in a larger context. Some, 
  like environmentalism, question widely held beliefs; others, like the civil 
  rights movement, challenge people to live up to their ideals. Either way, the 
  political and cultural arms of such movements together accomplish what neither 
  could alone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">What cultural assumptions do world 
  federalists challenge? We're saying, "People outside your borders are no less 
  morally important than those inside them. It's not acceptable that children's 
  chances of surviving are dictated by arbitrary lines around their place of birth." 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">In April 2002, human rights groups 
  and world federalists celebrated the creation of the International Criminal 
  Court. This is a permanent body for trying individuals suspected of committing 
  war crimes, genocide, or crimes against humanity, including murder, enslavement, 
  deportation, torture, rape, genocide and apartheid. Unfortunately, the United 
  States has withdrawn from the treaty creating the ICC, but this will not stop 
  the court from going forward. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">There is a powerful reframe in 
  the very term "crimes against humanity." Certain acts are so heinous that, if 
  committed against civilians during a war, they are considered crimes not just 
  against their specific victims but against all of humanity. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">"For total greed, rapacity, heartlessness 
  and irresponsibility there is nothing to match a nation," wrote Lewis Thomas 
  in <i>The Lives of a Cell</i>. Surely we can do better than this. Indeed, if 
  humanity is to survive, we have to do better. Our loyalties, as Carl Sagan put 
  it, must be to the species and the planet.<b> </b></font></p>
