  and Nonviolence<br>

  Living a philosophy of nonviolence is often thought as impractical in today's 
  world. The amount of violence surrounding us is staggering. From the media covering 
  the destructiveness of terrorism to our entertainment, violence abounds in massive 
  proportions. Those who believe they don't have a voice in society often compensate 
  for this powerlessness through violence and the fear response it creates in 
  others. Because fear and violence are still driving forces in our world, the 
  governments of all the nations continually pour out massive fortunes for creating 
  more weapons and preparing them for the next great war.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">With such an atmosphere of paranoia, 
  fear and antagonism that is as old as humanity itself, it is little wonder that 
  habits from ages past continue to dominate our present. But there is something 
  else at work in the world that demands our attention. It has been growing stronger 
  ever since Christ and Buddha came on the scene over two thousand years ago. 
  These two spiritual giants are often credited with initiating humanity's slow 
  transformation from a tribal consciousness to that of a world centric one. These 
  historical figures were from different cultures but their message was identical. 
  They both taught about the power of peace. Both followed the principal that 
  hate and violence will not drive out hate and violence but that only love can 
  break its endless cycle.<br>
  <br>
  Nonviolence as a philosophy has recently shown great potential in the life work 
  of Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Theresa, Mohandis Gandhi, The Dalai Lama, 
  and Thich Nhat Hanh. It is through their writings that a wider world audience 
  is beginning to see the logic of this philosophy and how compassion can become 
  a transformative tool in bringing about much needed political and social change. 
  It is the potential of nonviolence that we must now seriously consider in a 
  world armed to the teeth with weapons of mass destruction and maps of apocalyptic 
  proportions. Humans are beginning to wake up to the horror of our situation 
  and how devastating the next world war would be for our civilization. <br>
  <br>
  To understand the dynamics of nonviolence, we must first understand the human 
  collective. Unfortunately it isn't possible for all humanity to be 100% nonviolent 
  all the time. Violence and nonviolence seem to be two sides of the same evolutionary 
  coin. Even on the American Dollar Bill we see this reality symbolized on the 
  great seal of the United States. The bald eagle is depicted holding an olive 
  branch in its right talons and arrows in its left. The olive branch is a symbol 
  for peace and nonviolence while the arrows are symbolic for war and self defense. 
  The bald eagle is facing the olive branches representing America's commitment 
  to peace. But the arrows available in the left talon, represent our willingness 
  to defend ourselves and those we love by any means necessary.<br>
  <br>
  As a microcosm of the whole, individual human beings also must develop their 
  capacity for peace and self defense. Nonviolence can be a great tool in certain 
  circumstances but applying it in every situation wouldn't always work. We don't 
  yet live in a utopian dream world; the Earth's nations are filled with millions 
  of human beings at very low levels of consciousness and violence is sometimes 
  the only language they understand. If you were a passenger on the American Airlines 
  flight about to be hijacked into the World Trade Towers, having an Arnold Schwarzenegger 
  on board would be more desirable than having a Jesus Christ or Gautama Buddha. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Violence is clearly more effective in stopping the terrorists once they've become 
  incited to turn their bodies into bombs and weapons of mass destruction. However, 
  few would argue against nonviolence being more effective in avoiding the causative 
  circumstances that incite terrorists to violence in the first place. For example, 
  having a more spiritually evolved administration with a consciousness like a 
  Christ and Buddha serving in the White House, would most likely ease tensions 
  in the Middle East enough to avoid the terrorist's call for Jihad. Iraq would 
  never have been invaded and public policy would change enough to get the ball 
  rolling on development of alternative energy to end dependency on foreign oil. 
  Furthermore, the Pentagon budget would be cut down so as to free up the much 
  needed resources to start a department of peace. It would also help us invest 
  more money towards combating environmental destruction, hunger, disease and 
  countless other social problems around the world that create conditions breeding 
  terrorists and thus justifying our military to demand more money for weapons 
  in fighting them. <br>
  <br>
  When we realistically talk about nonviolence, it is important we recognize that 
  society is unable to be 100% nonviolent in all circumstances. There was a perfect 
  illustration of this reality in the 1950's and 1960's civil rights movement. 
  On one side you had Martin Luther King Jr. and SNCC demanding justice for black 
  America and using nonviolent means to get it. Waiting in the wings were Malcolm 
  X and the Black Panthers. They warned that if the white power structure didn't 
  listen to the righteous and just demands of King and SNCC, they would achieve 
  them through violent means.<br>
  <br>
  Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi before him, would travel from city to city 
  in peace with their nonviolent marchers but there were always those undisciplined 
  people outside the movement who would incite violence and destruction to property. 
  It was this threat of anarchy from outside the movement that would often make 
  the white power structure uneasy enough to take action. Eventually they ended 
  segregation and the blatant injustices throughout the society. <br>
  <br>
  On one level, the nonviolent aspect of the civil rights movement appealed to 
  the conscience of concerned whites who watched with horror as blacks were brutalized 
  and beaten by police and hateful mobs. On another level, the violent aspect 
  of the civil rights movement spoke to racist whites with lower levels of consciousness 
  who became terrified by the threats made by the Black Panthers and Malcolm X. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Because justice only works by appealing to these two levels of consciousness 
  in society, there must be a large percentage of the population at higher levels 
  of development. There are numerous models available to chart the stages of human 
  growth and they are all relevant, but for this article, I will be using the 
  Spiral Dynamics Model of human evolution developed by Claire Graves and Don 
  Beck but described in detail below by Ken Wilber:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"> <a href="http://www.chooseyourlife.com/ml/docs/SpiralDynamics.htm" target="_blank"><b>Ken 
  Wilber's Summary of Spiral Dynamics </b></a></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">So in speaking about a large number 
  of humans at high stages of development, I am referring to those with a center 
  of gravity at the blue meme or higher. Nonviolence would most likely not work 
  in a society such as 1994 Rewanda where genocide decimated hundreds of thousands 
  of people and came at the hands of those most likely at a red meme or lower 
  center of gravity. The United States and Europe are good staging grounds for 
  nonviolent social and political change simply because their population's center 
  of gravity hangs at the orange meme or higher. <br>
  <br>
  Focusing on the nonviolent aspect of any movement for justice and progressive 
  change, there must be a purification of those exemplifying it's cause. There 
  is a transformation of one's lifestyle to uphold a higher principle of love 
  and goodwill for all humankind. It is absurd to think that people can demand 
  justice when their lives aren't yet committed to living justly. When this purification 
  has taken place, an attack on the movement is less likely to be tolerated by 
  society at large. <br>
  <br>
  Putting this theory to work on the world stage, if Saddam Hussein never held 
  power and Iraq had a progressive democratic government providing freedom to 
  all its people, they would have never invaded Kuwait or attacked Israel. In 
  turn, the world community would have never tolerated America's attack on their 
  country and George W. Bush would feel less threatened with their nation having 
  weapons of mass destruction. On the same token, if Jesus Christ were a criminal, 
  lived an egotistical, hate filled life while attacking innocent people, there 
  would never have been outrage over his execution or the massive following that 
  projected him as the leader of one of the world's largest religious movements. 
  Righteousness and purity is a prerequisite for everyone serving any nonviolent 
  movement seeking a just revolution. <br>
  <br>
  There must also be purification of those serving the defending aspect of any 
  movement for justice and progressive change. A sound mind is all that stands 
  in the way of the misuse and abuses of power. As a leader, Malcolm X used his 
  weapons and power wisely because of a purification he went through after being 
  imprisoned for living a life of crime and recklessness.<br>
  <br>
  When people or nations have great power, their responsibility to wield it becomes 
  just as great. If the United States indiscriminately used nuclear weapons against 
  any nation opposing its policies, the rest of the world would unite against 
  us and do everything they could to destroy our government. The most practical 
  use of the world's nuclear weapons is in their not being used at all. It is 
  through a wise use of power that allows for the flowering of peace and justice.<br>
  <br>
  It is unlikely that the violent and nonviolent methods for revolution will ever 
  stop working side by side. Even though they both need each other, they also 
  have traditionally kept their distance. Having Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm 
  X marching side by side would be perceived as hypocritical by many in society, 
  although, both King and X did eventually meet and shared a private admiration 
  for each other even though their rhetoric might indicate otherwise.<br>
  <br>
  A nonviolent movement could make great strides in helping the cause of uniting 
  humanity. In the near future it is very likely we will see such a movement toward 
  the establishment of a federal world government. This will most likely be accompanied 
  by those seeking to empower and defend this cause by any means necessary. These 
  balancing factions will help us transcend the threshold guardian generator of 
  global unity; religious fundamentalism. A nonviolent movement for world unity 
  will help keep people from buying into a fatalistic paradigm that sees humanity 
  as doomed agents of a wrathful and fascist God's divine plan of having the world 
  be destroyed so it can be saved.<font size="5"><font face="Arial"> </font></font></font></p>
