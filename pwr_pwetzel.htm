  The mission of the Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions is to cultivate 
  harmony between the world's religious and spiritual communities and foster their 
  engagement with the world and its other guiding institutions in order to achieve 
  a peaceful, just, and sustainable world.<br>
  <br>
  The Parliament of the World's Religions held its inaugural event as part of 
  the Columbian Exposition in 1893 in Chicago. This historic gathering is widely 
  regarded as the beginning of the inter-religious movement worldwide. It took 
  until the year 1993 (the 100th anniversary of the original meeting) before the 
  Second Parliament was convened in Chicago. Eight thousand people from around 
  the world came together to share their identities, to celebrate diversity and 
  harmony, and to explore religious and spiritual responses to critical issues 
  facing the global community.<br>
  <br>
  In 1999, the Third Parliament in Cape Town, South Africa called the world's 
  attention to the inter-religious movement's powerful contribution to overcoming 
  apartheid and building a new South Africa. This year, the Fourth Parliament 
  held in Barcelona, Spain attracted more than 8,000 religious leaders (Rev. Dirk 
  Ficca, the Council for the Parliament of the World's Religions Executive Director; 
  Rabbi David Rosen; Rev. Charles Gibbs, United Religions Initiative executive 
  director and hundreds more) and lay people (Nobel Prize Winner Shirin Ebadi, 
  well-known doctor and author Deepak Chopra, Jane Goodall, Raimon Pannikar, Dr. 
  Federico Zaragoza -- former Director General of UNESCO -- and thousands more, 
  including me) gathering to address "Overcoming Religiously Motivated Violence" 
  and other major issues facing the world (such as "Access to Clean Water", "Supporting 
  Refugees", and "Eliminating the Burden of International Debt on Poor Countries").<br>
  <br>
  I have been privileged to work for PAX 2100 (<a href="http://www.pax2100.org" target="_blank">www.pax2100.org</a>) 
  as its executive director for the past two and a half years. The vision and 
  goal of PAX 2100 is the economic, political, and social wellness of all individuals, 
  cultures, and nations in a global framework that assures each person: PEACE, 
  justice, the right of retaining cultural identity, fair access to the earth's 
  resources, health care, education, the right and opportunity to work, freedom 
  of speech, and religion, the right to move freely around the world and to participate 
  in its governance.<br>
  <br>
  Holding to this vision has been the most difficult and rewarding endeavor I 
  have ever been involved with. It has taken me to new places, conferences, and 
  countless meetings with nonprofit representatives from around the world. One 
  of the greatest pleasures for me in this work has been my involvement with the 
  Interfaith Initiative of Santa Barbara County, the Goleta Presbyterian Church 
  and now the Parliament for the World's Religions. Our work has focused on the 
  myriad ways in which we can all come to a better understanding of the religious 
  diversity in the world and how this understanding might lead us in developing 
  a "Culture of Peace". Through open dialogue and with open hearts and minds we 
  strive to understand, accept, and learn from each other about the major religions 
  and traditions that make up the framework of the world's spiritual movement.<br>
  <br>
  We have come to the consensus that the major religions have so much more in 
  common than ways in which they differ. I am referring mostly to the common values 
  shared between the various faith traditions, like the Golden Rule, which when 
  translated from the various spiritual texts is almost identical (treat others 
  in the way you wish to be treated -- simply love one another). This has been 
  beautifully summarized by a good friend of PAX 2100, Religious Studies Professor 
  Nandini Ayer at the University of California, Santa Barbara, as follows: "He 
  who loves, lives; he who loves himself lives in hell; he who loves another lives 
  on earth; he who loves others lives in heaven; but he who silently adores the 
  Self of all creatures, lives in that Self, and it is Eternal PEACE." This statement 
  and the Golden Rule (what many consider to be the universal message of religion) 
  is the easiest way I can describe the work of this year's Parliament.<br>
  <br>
  By focusing on the theme of this year's Parliament, "Pathways to Peace: the 
  Wisdom of Listening, the Power of Commitment", I can envision a world in which 
  we come to understand and tolerate our differences and celebrate our commonalities. 
  With a simple and profound act of treating each other in ways that we wish to 
  be treated, miracles can and do occur.<br>
