  1. QUOTE OF THE MONTH<br>
  <br>
  "It isn't important in which sea or lake you observe a slick of pollution, or 
  in the forests of which country a fire breaks out, or on which continent a hurricane 
  arises. You are standing guard over the whole of our Earth." --Yuri Artyukhin, 
  astronaut<br>
  <br>

  2. WHAT'S NEW AT WORLD BEYOND BORDERS<br>
  <br>
  April is here and Earth Day is coming up soon. Here at World Beyond Borders, 
  we want to use that day to debut a brand new outreach tool -- a five foot long 
  banner printed with boxes representing world military spending. Display this 
  banner, get out your markers, and let people spend the $780 billion! How much 
  goes to fight hunger and restore the rainforests? How much to explore space? 
  How much for tax cuts? And we won't be the only ones using it. You or your group 
  can check out the banner online, receive it by mail, and just send it back to 
  us when you're done. What a multiplier effect!<br>
  <br>
  We have a design (www.worldbeyondborders.org/banner.gif) but we need money to 
  print it and attach an erasable covering. Can you help us out? We need $150 
  by April 15 -- a week before Earth Day. Please use the PayPal form on our home 
  page to donate, or email Jane Shevtsov, jane@worldbeyondborders.org, to ask 
  about sending a check. (Sorry, donations aren't tax deductible.) If you can 
  provide free or discounted printing, we'll also take that. Contribute to the 
  creation of a new, creative and fun outreach tool!<br>
  <br>
  What else is new at World Beyond Borders? All our article pages now have a BabelFish 
  translator box that allows the site to be viewed in Chinese, German, Japanese, 
  Korean, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. Machine translations are always 
  imperfect (sometimes hilariously so), but these do help.<br>
  <br>
  We are not announcing new content this month, but something huge is coming. 
  Keep an eye out for new stuff that will be added throughout the month. The official 
  announcement will come in our May newsletter. <br>
  <br>
  Please send article ideas or submissions to Jane Shevtsov, <br>
  jane@worldbeyondborders.org. <br>

  3. FAREWELL TO PETER USTINOV<br>
  by Eli Williamson-Jones<br>
  <br>
  On March 28th, the world lost a great cosmopolitan and renaissance man. Peter 
  Ustinov died of heart failure at his home in Switzerland at the age of 82. Ustinov 
  leaves an impressive legacy as a double Oscar winning actor whose career spanned 
  over sixty years. His most famous movies include Spartacus, Logan's Run and 
  more recently, Lorenzo's Oil. Ustinov was also a TV actor, screenwriter, novelist, 
  linguist, World War II soldier, public speaker, ambassador for UNICEF and president 
  of the World Federalist Movement. <br>
  <br>
  Ustinov became a world federalist in the 1950's and also was a strong advocate 
  for creating a United States of Europe. He also supported the NGO Coalition 
  for the International Criminal Court and WFM's efforts to democratize and empower 
  the United Nations. Ustinov believed the most effective way to eliminate war 
  and suffering in the world was to initiate economic and political unification 
  through democratic means. He said, "World government is not only possible, it 
  is inevitable; and when it comes, it will appeal to patriotism in its truest, 
  in its only sense, the patriotism of men who love their national heritages so 
  deeply that they wish to preserve them in safety for the common good."<br>
  <br>
  Ustinov was also known for his witty remarks, some of which are presented below. 
  <br>
  <br>
  "Beliefs are what divide people. Doubt unites them." <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, the balance of nature decrees that a super-abundance of dreams 
  is paid for by a growing potential for nightmares." <br>
  <br>
  "If the world should blow itself up, the last audible voice would be that of 
  an expert saying it can't be done." <br>
  <br>
  "Love is an act of endless forgiveness, a tender look which becomes a habit." 
  <br>
  <br>

  4. WHAT YOU CAN DO<br>
  <br>
  *Use the Ustinov obituary to talk about global government with a film buff friend.<br>
  <br>
  *Translate one (or all) of our articles into another language, especially if 
  you know one not covered by the BabelFish translator. <br>
