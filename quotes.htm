<p>"Let us plant dates even though those who plant them will never eat them. We 
  must live by the love of what we will never see. This is the secret discipline. 
  It is a refusal to let the creative act be dissolved away in immediate sense 
  experience, and a stubborn commitment to the future of our grandchildren. Such 
  disciplined love is what has given prophets, revolutionaries, and saints the 
  courage to die for the future they envisaged. They make their own bodies the 
  seed of their highest hope." --Ruben Alves, <i>Tomorrow's Child</i></p>
<p>"Everyone lives downstream from someone else." --anonymous</p>
<p>"There is enough bad in people to make law necessary, and enough good in people 
  to make it workable." --Anonymous</p>
<p>"It isn't important in which sea or lake you observe a slick of pollution, 
  or in the forests of which country a fire breaks out, or on which continent 
  a hurricane arises. You are standing guard over the whole of our Earth." --Yuri 
  Artyukhin, astronaut</p>
<p>"There are no nations! There is only humanity. And if we don't come to understand 
  that right soon, there will be no nations, because there will be no humanity." 
  --Isaac Asimov, <i>I. Asimov</i></p>
<p>"It is quite clear that as long as the nations of the world spend most of their 
  energy, money, and emotional strength in quarreling with words and weapons, 
  a true offensive against the common problems that threaten human survival is 
  not very likely. A world government that can channel human efforts in the direction 
  of the great solutions seems desirable, even essential. Naturally, such a world 
  government should be a federal one, with regional and local autonomy safeguarded 
  and with cultural diversity promoted." --Isaac Asimov, "The Dreams of Science 
  Fiction"</p>
<p>"It isn't important whose [the Earth] is, just that it is." --Oleg Atkov, astronaut</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><font size="3" color="#336633"><a name="B">B</a></font></p>
<p>"We should take care, in inculcating patriotism into our boys and girls, that 
  is a patriotism above the narrow sentiment which usually stops at one's country, 
  and thus inspires jealousy and enmity in dealing with others... Our patriotism 
  should be of the wider, nobler kind which recognises justice and reasonableness 
  in the claims of others and which lead our country into comradeship with...the 
  other nations of the world." --Lord Baden-Powell, founder of Boy Scouting</p>
<p>"As I looked down, I saw a large river meandering slowly along for miles, passing 
  from one country to another without stopping. I also saw huge forests, extending 
  along several borders. And I watched the extent of one ocean touch the shores 
  of separate continents. Two words leaped to mind as I looked down on all this: 
  commonality and interdependence. We are one world." --John-David Bartoe, astronaut</p>
<p>"The first day or so we all pointed to our countries. The third or fourth day 
  we were pointing to our continents. By the fifth day, we were aware of only 
  one Earth." --Sultan bin Salman Al-Saud, astronaut</p>
<p>"When you're finally up on the moon, looking back at the earth, all these differences 
  and nationalistic traits are pretty well going to blend and you're going to 
  get a concept that maybe this is really one world and why the hell can't we 
  learn to live together like decent people?" --Frank Borman, astronaut</p>
<p>"How long will it be 'till we've turned<br>
  To the tasks and the skills<br>
  That we'll have to have learned<br>
  If we're going to find our place in the future<br>
  And have something to offer<br>
  Where this planet's concerned?" --Jackson Browne, musician, "How Long"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"People stand themselves next to the righteous<br>
  They believe the things they say are true<br>
  They speak in terms of what divides us<br>
  To justify the violence they do<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is one, it is one<br>
  One world spinning 'round the sun<br>
  Wherever it is you call home<br>
  Whatever country you come from<br>
  It is one" --Jackson Browne, musician, "It is One"</p>
<p>"Say it isn't true<br>
  That there always has been and always will be war<br>
  Say it isn't true<br>
  And apart from all the fine things that man has struggled for<br>
  Say it isn't true<br>
  There always has been and always will be war" --Jackson Browne, musician, "Say 
  It Isn't True"</p>
<p>"Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency." --Daniel Burnham, architect of first skyscraper (1864-1912)</p>

<p>"The love of one's country is a splendid thing. But why should love stop at 
  the border?" --Pablo Casals</p>
<p>"There is no national science just as there is no national multiplication table; what is national is no longer science." --Anton Chekhov</p>
<p>"Unless some effective world supergovernment for the purpose of preventing 
  war can be set up ... the prospects for peace and human progress are dark ....If 
  .... it is found possible to build a world organization of irresistible force 
  and inviolable authority for the purpose of securing peace, there are no limits 
  to the blessings which all men enjoy and share." --Winston Churchill</p>
<p>"Unless we establish some form of world government, it will not be possible 
  for us to avert a World War III in the future." --Winston Churchill</p>
<p>"War is an invention of the human mind. The human mind can invent peace with 
  justice." --Norman Cousins</p>
<p>"There are no boundaries in the real Planet Earth. No United States, no Russia, no China, no Taiwan. Rivers flow unimpeded across the swaths of continents. The persistent tides, the pulse of the sea do not discriminate; they push against all the varied shores on Earth." --Jacques-Yves Cousteau, oceanographer</p>
<p>"[T]hose advocates who work for world peace by urging a system of world government 
  are called impractical dreamers. Those impractical dreamers are entitled to 
  ask their critics what is so practical about war." --Walter Cronkite </p>
<p>&quot;hatred bounces.&quot; --e.e. cummings </p>

<p>&quot;Contemplating the suffering which is unbearable to us, and is unbearable 
  to others, too, can produce awake mind, which arises from the compassion that 
  wishes to free all living beings from suffering.&quot; --The Dalai Lama </p>
<p>"All those who seek to destroy the liberties of a democratic nation ought to 
  know that war is the surest and shortest means to accomplish it." --Alexis de 
  Tocqueville</p>
<p>"I have no country to fight for: my country is the earth, and I am a citizen 
  of the world." --Eugene V. Debs</p>
<p>"No man is an island entire of itself... Any man's death diminishes me because 
  I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell 
  tolls; it tolls for thee." --John Donne</p>
<p>"It is obvious that no difficulty in the way of world government can match 
  the danger of a world without it." --Carl Van Doren </p>
<p>"World federation is an ideal that will not die. More and more people are coming 
  to realize that peace must be more than an interlude if we are to survive; that 
  peace is a produce of law and order; that law is essential if the force of arms 
  is not to rule the world." --William O. Douglas, US Supreme Court Justice</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><font size="3" color="#336633"><a name="E">E</a></font></p>
<p>"I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV 
  will be fought with sticks and stones." --Albert Einstein</p>
<p>&quot;Problems cannot be solved at the same level of consciousness that created 
  them.&quot; --Albert Einstein</p>
<p>"A world government with powers adequate to guarantee security is not a remote 
  ideal for the distant future. It is an urgent necessity if our civilization 
  is to survive." -- Albert Einstein</p>
<p> "There is no salvation for civilization, or even the human race, other than 
  the creation of a world government." -- Albert Einstein </p>
<p>"With all my heart I believe that the world's present system of sovereign nations 
  can only lead to barbarism, war and inhumanity, and that only world law can 
  assure progress towards a civilized peaceful community." --Albert Einstein</p>
<p>"I like to believe that people in the long run are going to do more to promote 
  peace than our governments. Indeed, I think that people want peace so much that 
  one of these days governments had better get out of the way and let them have 
  it." --Dwight D. Eisenhower (1890 - 1969)</p>
<p>"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, 
  in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who 
  are cold and are not clothed. The world in arms is not spending money alone. 
  It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the 
  hopes of its children." --Dwight D. Eisenhower </p>
<p>"The world no longer has a choice between force and law; if civilization is 
  to survive, it must choose the rule of law." --Dwight D. Eisenhower </p>
<p>"... we have been warned by the power of modern weapons, that peace may be 
  the only climate possible for human life itself ... There must be law, steadily 
  invoked and respected by all nations, for without law, the world promises only 
  such meager justice as the pity of the strong upon the weak." -- President Dwight 
  D. Eisenhower</p>
<p>"... the emergency committee of atomic scientists, having explored for two 
  years all means other than world government for making responsible the control 
  of atomic energy, has become convinced that no other method than world government 
  can be expected to prove effective, and that the attainment of world government 
  is therefore the most urgent problem now facing mankind." --Emergency Committee 
  of Atomic Scientists, 1948 Resolution</p>
<p>"If the name of the country has such a nature as to create bonds between those 
  who have a common country, why do not men resolve then that the earth should 
  become the country of all?" --Erasmus, <i>Peace Protests</i>, 16th century</p>
<p>"There is the sky, which is all men's together..." --Euripides (412 B.C.)</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><font size="3" color="#336633"><a name="F">F</a></font></p>
<p>"From space I saw Earth -- indescribably beautiful and with the scars of national 
  boundaries gone." --Muhammad Ahmad Faris, astronaut</p>
<p>"All wars are civil wars, because all men are brothers... Each one owes infinitely 
  more to the human race than to the particular country in which he was born." 
  --Francois Fenelon, theologian and writer (1651-1715)</p>
<p>"I prefer law to war under all circumstances." --Benjamin Ferencz, Nuremberg prosecutor</p>
<p>"In spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at 
  heart." --Anne Frank </p>
<p>"God grant, that not only the Love of Liberty, but a thorough Knowledge of 
  the Rights of Man, may pervade all the Nations of the Earth, so that a Philosopher 
  may set his foot anywhere on its Surface, and say, "This is my Country."" --Benjamin 
  Franklin (1706-1790)</p>
<p>"Civilization is a process in the service of Eros, whose purpose is to combine 
  single human individuals, and after that families, then races, peoples and nations, 
  into one great unity, the unity of mankind." --Sigmund Freud (1856-1939)</p>
<p>"We are going to have to find ways of organizing ourselves cooperatively, sanely, 
  scientifically, harmonically and in regenerative spontaneity with the rest of 
  humanity around the earth.... We are not going to be able to operate our spaceship 
  earth successfully nor for much longer unless we see it as a whole spaceship 
  and our fate as common." --Buckminster Fuller</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><font size="3" color="#336633"><a name="G">G</a></font></p>
<p>"I am part and parcel of the whole and cannot find God apart from the rest 
  of humanity." --Mohandas Gandhi (1869-1948)</p>
<p>"Unity to be real must stand the severest strain without breaking." --Mohandas 
  Gandhi (1869-1948)</p>
<p>&quot;I have learned through bitter experience the one supreme lesson: to conserve 
  my anger, and, as heat conserved is transmitted into energy, even so our anger 
  controlled can be transmitted into a power which can move the world.&quot; --Mohandas 
  Gandhi </p>
<p>"My country is the world; my countrymen are mankind." --William Lloyd Garrison, 
  abolitionist</p>
<p>"Where is the justice of political power if it executes the murderer and jails 
  the plunderer, and then itself marches upon neighboring lands, killing thousands 
  and pillaging the very hills?" --Kahlil Gibran, "The Voice of the Poet"</p>
<p>"I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule 
  or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, 
  black men, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. 
  We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't 
  want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. 
  And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone... The aeroplane and 
  the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these things cries 
  out for the goodness in man; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity 
  of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions 
  of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes 
  men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say "Do 
  not despair." The misery that has come upon us is but the passing of greed, 
  the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will 
  pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return 
  to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish... Now let 
  us fight to free the world! To do away with national barriers! To do away with 
  greed, with hate and intolerance! Let us fight for a world of reason, a world 
  where science and progress will lead to the happiness of us all... [I]n the 
  name of democracy, let us unite!" --<i>The Great Dictator</i> (1940)</p>
<p>"There is an increasing awareness of the need for some form of global government." 
  --Mikhail Gorbachev</p>

<p>&quot;We are here to awaken from the illusion of our separateness.&quot; --Thich 
  Nhat Hanh </p>
<p>"The bomb that fell on Hiroshima fell on America, too." --Hermann Hagedorn</p>
<p>"When you look up at the sky, you have a feeling of unity, which delights you 
  and makes you giddy." --Ferdinand Hodler</p>
<p>"How can we fret and stew sub specie aeternitatis - under the calm gaze of 
  ancient Tao? The salt of the sea is in our blood; the calcium of the rocks is 
  in our bones; the genes of ten thousand generations of stalwart progenitors 
  are in our cells. The sun shines and we smile. The winds rage and we bend before 
  them. The blossoms open and we rejoice. Earth is our long home." --Stewart W. 
  Holmes, 1973</p>
<p>No army can withstand the strength of an idea whose time has come. -- Victor 
  Hugo, poet, novelist and dramatist (1802-1885)</p>
<p>"A world community can exist only with world communication, which means something 
  more than extensive shortwave facilities scattered about the globe. It means 
  common understanding, a common tradition, common ideas, and common ideals." 
  --Robert M. Hutchins (1899-1977)</p>
<p>"How vast those Orbs must be, and now inconsiderable this Earth, the Theatre 
  upon which all our mighty Designs, all our Navigations, and all our Wars are 
  transacted, is when compared to them.? A very fit consideration, and matter 
  of Reflection, for those Kings and Princes who sacrifice the Lives of so many 
  People, only to flatter their Ambition in being Masters of some pitiful corner 
  of this small Spot." --Christiaan Huygens, New Conjectures Concerning the Planetary 
  Worlds, Their Inhabitants and Productions, c. 1690. </p>
<p>"Any scientist can testify that a dead ocean means a dead planet .... No national 
  law, no national precautions can save the planet. The ocean, more than any other 
  part of our planet, ... is a classic example of the absolute need for international 
  global action." --Thor Hyerdahl</p>

<p>The international community should support a system of laws to regularize international

  order." -- Pope John Paul II</p>

<p>"Mounting an expedition to actualize a Compassionate Commonwealth of all peoples... 
  is the great spiritual challenge of our time." --Sam Keen</p>
<p>"Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet. We all breathe 
  the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal." 
  --John F. Kennedy</p>
<p>"World peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his 
  neighbor -- it requires only that they live together with mutual tolerance, 
  submitting their disputes to a just and peaceful settlement." --John F. Kennedy</p>
<p>"We must create world-wide law and law enforcement as we outlaw world-wide 
  war and weapons" -- President John F. Kennedy</p>
<p>"Mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind." --John 
  F. Kennedy </p>
<p>"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an 
  inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny." --Martin 
  Luther King, Jr.</p>
<p>"We have learned to fly the air like birds and swim the sea like fish but we 
  have not learned the simple art of living together as brothers." --Martin Luther 
  King Jr. </p>
<p>"The hope of a secure and livable world lies with disciplined non-conformists, 
  who are dedicated to justice, peace and brotherhood. The trailblazers in human, 
  academic, scientific, and religious freedom have always been non-conformists." 
  --Martin Luther King Jr. </p>
<p>"We must in strength and humility meet hate with love. Maybe in some distant 
  Utopia, you say, that idea will work, but not in the hard cold world in which 
  we live. My friends, we have followed the so called practical way for too long 
  a time now, and it has led inexorably to deeper confusion and chaos. Time is 
  cluttered with the wreckage of communities which surrendered to hatred and violence. 
  For the salvation of our nation and the salvation of mankind, we must follow 
  another way. To our most bitter opponents we say: "We shall match your capacity 
  to inflict suffering by our capacity to endure suffering. We shall meet your 
  physical force with soul force. Do to us what you will, and we shall continue 
  to love you. One day we shall win freedom, but not only for ourselves. We shall 
  so appeal to your heart and conscience that we shall win you in the process, 
  and our victory will be a double victory.&quot; --Martin Luther King Jr. </p>
<p>"I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals 
  a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, 
  equality and freedom for their spirits. I believe that what self-centered men 
  have torn down, men other-centered can build up. I still believe that one day 
  mankind will bow before the altars of God and be crowned triumphant over war 
  and bloodshed, and nonviolent redemptive goodwill will proclaim the rule of 
  the land." --Martin Luther King Jr. --- Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Speech, 
  December 10, 1964 </p>
<p>"Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit 
  and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, 
  racism, and militarism. This call for a world-wide fellowship that lifts neighborly 
  concern beyond one's tribe, race, class, and nation is in reality a call for 
  an all-embracing and unconditional love for all men and women." --Martin Luther 
  King, Jr.</p>
<p>"...we must realize that a vast majority of believers are still searching and 
  will continue to search for the being who is the "source of human good." Those 
  who seek with clear heads and sincere hearts will in some measure find. Of course 
  the true seeker will realize that there is no one way to find God. To be sure, 
  there are many possible ways of finding God." --Martin Luther King, Jr. </p>
<p>"In a real sense, all life is interrelated. All men are caught in an inescapable 
  network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects 
  one directly affects all indirectly. I can never be what I ought to be until 
  you are what you ought to be, and you can never be what you ought to be until 
  I am what I ought to be. This is the interrelated structure of reality." --Martin 
  Luther King, Jr. </p>
<p>"Legislation may not change the heart, but it will restrain the heartless." --Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
<p>"The potential beauty of human life is constantly made ugly by man's ever recurring 
  song of retaliation. The oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever rising 
  tides of revenge. Man has never risen above the injunction of the lex talionis: 
  "Life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot." 
  In spite of the fact that the law of revenge solves no social problems, men 
  continue to follow its disastrous leading. History is cluttered with the wreckage 
  of nations and individuals that pursued this self-defeating path." --Martin 
  Luther King, Jr. </p>
<p>"Every war already carries within it the war which will answer it. Every 
  war is answered by a new war, until everything, everything is smashed." 
  --Kothe Kollwitz </p>
<p>"After an orange cloud -- formed as a result of a dust storm over the Sahara 
  and caught up by air currents -- reached the Philippines and settled there with 
  rain, I understood that we are all sailing in the same boat." --Vladimir Kovalyonok, 
  astronaut</p>
<p>"When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind." --J. Krishnamurti, <i>Freedom from the Known</i></p>
<p>"I think we're in a new era where the advancing tide is towards human unity, 
  where people all around the world want to come together. The United States is 
  in a position where it can lead the way towards that and it can do it in practical 
  ways by affirming the power of the United Nations so that the international 
  process makes decisions on international security." --Dennis Kucinich, US congressman</p>
<p>"Our vision of interconnectedness resonates with new networks of world citizens 
  in nongovernmental organizations linking from numberless centers of energy, 
  expressing the emergence of a new organic whole, seeking unity within and across 
  national lines... If governments and their leaders, bound by hierarchy and patriarchy, 
  wedded to military might for legitimacy, fail to grasp the implications of an 
  emerging world consciousness for cooperation, for peace and for sustainability, 
  they may become irrelevant." --Dennis Kucinich, US congressman, "Spirit and 
  Stardust"</p>
<p>"[T]here is a deeper truth expressed in the unity of the United States. [I]mplicate 
  in the union of our country is the union of all people. [A]ll people are essentially 
  one. [T]he world is interconnected not only on the material level of economics, 
  trade, communication, and transportation, but innerconnected through human consciousness, 
  through the human heart, through the heart of the world, through the simply 
  expressed impulse and yearning to be and to breathe free." --Dennis Kucinich, 
  US congressman, "A Prayer for America"</p>

<p>"The abolition of war is no longer an ethical question to be pondered solely 
  by learned philosophers and ecclesiastics, but a hard core one for the decision 
  of the masses whose survival is the issue. Many will tell you with mockery and 
  ridicule that the abolition of war can only be a dream - that it is the vague 
  imagining of a visionary. But we must go on or we will go under ... We must 
  have new thoughts, new ideas, new concepts. We must break out of the straightjacket 
  of the past. We must sufficient imagination and courage to translate the universal 
  wish for peace - which is rapidly becoming a necessity - into actuality." -General 
  Douglas MacArthur, July 5, 1961 </p>
<p>&quot;You point out that war is only a symptom of the whole horrid business 
  of human behavior, and cannot be isolated. And that, even if we abolish war, 
  we shall not abolish hate and greed. So might it have been argued about slave 
  emancipation, that slavery was but one aspect of human disgustingness, and that 
  to abolish it would not end the barbarity that causes it. But did the abolitionists 
  therefore waste their breath? And do we waste ours now in protesting against 
  war?&quot; --Rose Macaulay </p>
<p>"So long as you are ready to die for humanity, the life of your country is 
  immortal." --Giuseppe Mazzini</p>
<p>&quot;I know war as few other men now living know it, and nothing to me is 
  more revolting. I have long advocated its complete abolition, as its very destructiveness 
  on both friend and foe has rendered it useless as a method of settling international 
  disputes.&quot; --Douglas MacArthur </p>
<p>"To see the earth as it truly is, small and blue in that eternal silence where 
  it floats, is to see riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness 
  in the eternal cold -- brothers who know now they are truly brothers." --Archibald 
  McLeish, poet</p>
<p>"We cannot live only for ourselves. A thousand fibers connect us with our fellow 
  men; and among those fibers, as sympathetic threads, our actions run as causes,

<p>"I dream of giving birth to a child who will ask: "Mother, what was war?"" 
  --Eve Merriam, writer</p>
<p>"The whole idea of compassion is based on a keen awareness of the interdependence 
  of all these living beings, which are all part of one another, and all involved 
  in one another." --Thomas Merton</p>
<p>&quot;In outer space you develop an instant global consciousness, a people 
  orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion 
  to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics 
  look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag 
  him a quarter of a million miles out and say, "Look at that, you son of a bitch." 
  --Edgar Mitchell </p>
<p>"Have I said clearly enough that the Community we created is not an end in itself? It is a process of change, continuing in that same process which in an earlier period produced our national forms of life. The sovereign nations of the past can no longer solve the problems of the present: they cannot ensure their own progress or control their own future. And the Community itself is only a stage on the way of the organized world of tomorrow." --Jean Monnet, conceiver of the European Community, now the European Union</p>

<p>"At a few hundred kilometers altitude, the Earth fills half your sky, and the 
  band of blue that stretches from Mindanao to Bombay, which your eye encompasses 
  in a single glance, can break your heart with its beauty. Home you think. Home. 
  This is my world. This is where I come from. Everyone I know, everyone I ever 
  heard of, grew up down there, under that relentless and exquisite blue." --Carl 
  Sagan, <i>Contact</i></p>
<p>"In the daylight, though, it's hard to see any sign of human habitation. But 
  at night, except for the polar aurora, everything you see is due to humans, 
  humming and blinking all over the planet. That swath of light is eastern North 
  America, continuous from Boston to Washington, a megalopolis in fact if not 
  in name. Over there is the burnoff of natural gas in Libya. The dazzling lights 
  of the Japanese shrimp fishing fleet have moved toward the South China Sea. 
  On every orbit, the Earth tells you new stories. You can see a volcanic eruption 
  in Kamchatka, a Saharan sandstorm approaching Brazil, unseasonably frigid weather 
  in New Zealand. You get to thinking of the Earth as an organism, a living thing. 
  You get to worry about it, care for it, wish it well. National boundaries are 
  as invisible as meridians of longitude, or the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. 
  The boundaries are arbitrary. The planet is real. Spaceflight, therefore, is 
  subversive. If they are fortunate enough to find themselves in Earth orbit, 
  most people, after a little meditation, have similar thoughts. The nations that 
  had instituted spaceflight had done so largely for nationalistic reasons; it 
  was a small irony that almost everyone who entered space received a startling 
  glimpse of a transnational perspective, of the Earth as one world." --Carl Sagan, 
  <i>Contact</i></p>
<p>"Human history can be viewed as a slowly dawning awareness that we are members 
  of a larger group. Initially our loyalties were to ourselves and our immediate 
  family, next, to bands of wandering hunter-gatherers, then to tribes, small 
  settlements, city-states, nations. We have broadened the circle of those we 
  love. We have now organized what are modestly described as super-powers, which 
  include groups of people from divergent ethnic and cultural backgrounds working 
  in some sense together--surely a humanizing and character building experience. 
  If we are to survive, our loyalties must be broadened further, to include the 
  whole human community, the entire planet Earth. Many of those who run the nations 
  will find this idea unpleasant. They will fear the loss of power. We will hear 
  much about treason and disloyalty. Rich nation-states will have to share their 
  wealth with poor ones. But the choice, as H. G. Wells once said in a different 
  context, is clearly the universe or nothing." --Carl Sagan, <i>Cosmos</i></p>
<p>"Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for Earth. Our obligation 
  to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and 
  vast, from which we spring." --Carl Sagan, <i>Cosmos</i> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On 
  it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human 
  being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, 
  thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every 
  hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, 
  every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, 
  hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt 
  politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner 
  in the history of our species lived there - on a mote of dust suspended in a 
  sunbeam.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of 
  the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors, so that, in 
  glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of 
  a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner 
  of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, 
  how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, 
  how fervent their hatreds.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;"Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that 
  we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point 
  of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. 
  In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come 
  from elsewhere to save us from ourselves." --Carl Sagan, <i>Pale Blue Dot</i></p>
<p>"Teller contended, not implausibly, that hydrogen bombs keep the peace, or 
  at least prevent thermonuclear war, because the consequences of warfare between 
  nuclear powers are now too dangerous. We haven't had a nuclear war yet, have 
  we? But all such arguments assume that the nuclear-armed nations are and always 
  will be, without exception, rational actors, and that bouts of anger and revenge 
  and madness will never overtake their leaders (or military and secret police 
  officers in charge of nuclear weapons). In the century of Hitler and Stalin, 
  this seems ingenuous." --Carl Sagan </p>
<p>"Whenever our ethnic or national prejudices are aroused, in times of scarcity, 
  during challenges to national self esteem or nerve, when we agonize about our 
  diminished cosmic place and purpose, or when fanaticism is bubbling up around 
  us - then, habits of thought familiar from ages past reach for the controls." 
  --Carl Sagan, <i>The Demon-Haunted World</i></p>
<p>"Up there in the immensity of the Cosmos, an inescapable perception awaits 
  us. National boundaries are not evident when we view the Earth from space. Fanatical 
  ethnic, religious or national chauvinisms are a little difficult to maintain 
  when we see our planet as a fragile blue crescent fading to become an inconspicuous 
  point of light against the bastion and citadel of the stars." --Carl Sagan,
  <i>Cosmos</i> </p>
<p>&quot;Compassion is not at all weak. It is the strength that arises out of 
  seeing the true nature of suffering in the world. Compassion allows us to bear 
  witness to that suffering, whether it is in ourselves or others, without fear; 
  it allows us to name injustice without hesitation, and to act strongly, with 
  all the skill at our disposal. To develop this mind state of compassion . . 
  . is to learn to live, as the Buddha put it, with sympathy for all living beings, 
  without exception.&quot; --Sharon Salzberg</p>
<p>"[I see] half a world to the left, half a world to the right. I can see it 
  all. The Earth is so small." --Vitali Sevastyanov, astronaut</p>
<p>"My mental boundaries expanded when I viewed the Earth against a black and 
  uninviting vacuum, yet my country's rich traditions had conditioned me to look 
  beyond man-made boundaries and prejudices. One does not have to undertake a 
  space flight to come by this feeling." --Rakesh Sharma, astronaut</p>
<p>"The Earth at night looks even more magical than it does during the day. There's 
  always a lightning storm happening somewhere. Flashes of lightning sometimes 
  cover up to a fourth of a continent. At first you see this as a natural disturbance, 
  the eruption of splashes as a majestic spectacle... All of a sudden, against 
  your will, you imagine that the lightning comes not from a natural storm but 
  from the explosions of bombs. No. That must never happen. Let only the northern 
  lights and lightning blaze above our precious Earth." --Vladimir Shatalov, astronaut</p>
<p>"You see things; and you say, "Why?" But I dream things that never were; and 
  I say, "Why not?"" --George Bernard Shaw, 1856-1950</p>

<p>&quot;If it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously

<p>"[Viewing the Earth from space,] you see a singleness and unity to it all that 
  we never perceive in the press of daily life. It seems such a vivid unity that

<p>"It will be just as easy for nations to get along in a republic of the world 
  as it is for you to get along in the republic of the United States. Now when 
  Kansas and Colorado have a quarrel over the water in the Arkansas river they

  the darkness of the deep; we see it turn upon itself in rage and hunger and 
  reshape itself, pursuing its relentless inconceivable purpose, until at last 
  it reaches us and its being beats through our brains and arteries... It is possible 
  to believe that all that the human mind has ever accomplished is but the dream 
  before the awakening... Out of our... lineage, minds will spring, that will 
  reach back to us in our littleness to know us better than we know ourselves. 
  A day will come, one day in the unending succession of days, when beings, beings
