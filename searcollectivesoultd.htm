  The Big Vision and Why We Should Talk About It<br>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I've been actively involved with the 
  World Federalist Association since 1990, when Wendell Harter, Ted Leutzinger 
  and Tom Camarella recruited me as a student here in Southern California. I went 
  on to receive my Ph.D. in International Policy Analysis, and consider myself 
  an international affairs professional, scholar, and activist. Consequently, 
  I've done a great deal of writing and speaking in the past decade directed at 
  people NOT members of WFA or any related organizations, NOT in the world federalist 
  orbit, NOT in many cases aware of our existence at all. What follows is my assessment 
  of the issues and ideas that resonate with such people - issues and ideas that 
  in my view have the potential to capture the imagination of many thousands of 
  new participants.<br>
  <br>
  I believe that any political and social movement that aspires to really make 
  the big time must center on some Big Ideas, simple and straightforward and easily 
  understandable and inspiring propositions that can grab people's hearts and 
  sear the collective soul. The examples of such successful movements are numerous. 
  No war in Iraq. Get out of Vietnam. No child labor. Save the rainforest. Health 
  and safety and rights and protections for workers. Equal women's rights. Equal 
  gay rights. Abolish slavery. Ban the bomb. A black man is a man.<br>
  <br>
  And it seems to me that global government advocates are the unique torchbearers 
  of three Big Ideas, which together have the potential to be no less than the 
  Great Story of the century ahead.<br>
  <br>
  &#149; The idea that war itself does not have to be a permanent part of the 
  human condition, that 200 separate sovereignties with their own armies and navies 
  and air forces is not the end of history, that war can become as impossible 
  between nations as it is now between California and Nevada, that we can create 
  enduring world peace through enforceable world law, that someday, truly, all 
  of us will "hear the war drum throb no longer, (and) see the battle flags all 
  furled." An essential part of this idea is the liberation of human potential 
  that would result. "A federation of all humanity," said our predecessor H.G. 
  Wells, "... would mean such a release and increase of human energy as to open 
  a new phase in human history." "My short-term vision is the abolition of nuclear 
  weapons," said 1995 Nobel Peace Laureate Joseph Rotblat at a public forum a 
  few years ago. "My long-term vision is the abolition of war." So must be our 
  long-term vision as well.<br>
  <br>
  &#149; The idea that something like a United World or a Federal Republic of 
  Earth -- that so many are familiar with through science fiction -- is in fact 
  our genuine real world aspiration. Before the galactic federation in Star Trek, 
  there was a world federation. About ten years ago Steven Spielberg had a cool 
  TV show set about 2050 about a submarine called Seaquest DSV. The crewmembers 
  all wore patches that said UEO - United Earth Organization. In the classic Martin 
  Sheen Outer Limits episode "Nightmare," the astronauts all wore patches that 
  said UE - United Earth. Countless science fiction novels take something like 
  a United World or a Federal Republic of Earth simply as part of the background 
  of a work of literature set a century or so in the future. One of the great 
  paradoxes of our movement is that while it's difficult for any of us to discern 
  how we're going to get from here to there, when we peer many decades into the 
  future it's difficult to imagine that we'll end up anywhere else. A United Earth 
  is an idea that is simple, elegant, and intuitively appealing to many. We need 
  to say that such a United Earth is not just science fiction, but the actual 
  destiny of humankind.<br>
  <br>
  &#149; The idea that for us -- as individual citizens of the world - OUR allegiance 
  to our country is less important than our allegiance to humanity. OUR highest 
  loyalty is not our national loyalty, but our universal loyalty. OUR national 
  patriotism is transcended by our planetary patriotism. In some ways I think 
  that these intangible ideals hold the greatest potential of all. People need 
  to be convinced of the desirability of a Federal Republic of Earth. But I have 
  found over and over again that they embrace these propositions immediately, 
  enthusiastically, and unreservedly. When I speak I tell the story of the crew 
  of the Apollo 8 spacecraft, floating over the mountains of the far side of the 
  moon, and then seeing - for the first time with human eyes - our single, borderless, 
  breathtaking planet, suspended among the blazing stars. Our singular and paramount 
  loyalty, to our single and lonely planet, can be the single greatest engine 
  taking our movement from what we now are, to what we can become.<br>
  <br>
  The realization of these three Big Ideas may well be quite distant. So I think 
  we also must advocate a number of nearer-term policy prescriptions as well. 
  These include: <br>
  <br>
  &#149; New structures of global governance, the comprehensive UN restructuring 
  agenda that was expressed in reports like that of the 1995 Commission on Global 
  Governance, redesigning the United Nations and rewriting the UN Charter, the 
  proposition that a United Nations designed for the world of the 1930s is far 
  from optimal for the challenges of the 21st Century.<br>
  <br>
  &#149; Universal human rights enforcement. The idea that we want to live in 
  a world where rape camps and machete massacres and torched villages are against 
  the law of the human community - and the human community possesses mechanisms 
  of law enforcement to stop the crimes and to bring the criminals to justice. 
  Such mechanisms include preventive diplomacy and peace building, the International 
  Criminal Court Treaty whose existence owes so much to our efforts, and a UN 
  Rapid Deployment Force. Such a force would have a different raison d'etre from 
  every national military force in the world. Its purpose would be not to protect 
  the national interests of any individual state, but the common human interest 
  we all share in preventing crimes against humanity and promoting the world rule 
  of law. And the citizens serving in such a force would not just be volunteering 
  to "serve their country." They would be volunteering to serve humanity.<br>
  <br>
  &#149; The idea that if democracy is the optimal form of human governance, then 
  we ought to aspire to it at every level of human governance - including the 
  global level. This means restructuring the UN Security Council, modifying and 
  eventually abolishing the profoundly undemocratic great power veto, talking 
  about alternative kinds of weighted voting systems. It means that just as we 
  elect individuals to represent us at the local level, state level, and national 
  level, so too ought we be able to do so at the global level. It means that just 
  as the democratic countries take for granted that they ought to be governed 
  by a parliament or legislature, so too ought we aspire to eventually create 
  something like a Parliament of Humankind. <br>
  <br>
  &#149; The idea that we must outlaw and abolish all weapons of mass destruction 
  through universal, verifiable, and enforceable conventions. Such abolition is 
  inconceivable without the empowered international institutions that we envision, 
  without mechanisms of world law enforcement. The danger of extinction after 
  the invention of the atomic bomb, of course, is THE issue that drove the early 
  years of our organization and our movement. And now that the WMD danger has 
  become again so immediate in the post-911 world, we can make great intellectual 
  and activist contributions by offering our own unique long-term solutions to 
  ending the WMD danger forever.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, I think it is vital that we emphasize that none of these - especially 
  my three Big Ideas - are our ideas. We can recruit many new converts, I am certain, 
  simply by educating people about the fact - almost wholly unknown today - that 
  the abolition of war through a single unified human community is one of the 
  Great Ideas in the heritage of humankind, that in previous eras it was championed 
  by Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, William O. Douglas, Henry Fonda, Alan 
  Cranston, Arnold Toynbee, Golda Meir, H.G. Wells, Victor Hugo, Alfred Lord Tennyson, 
  Immanuel Kant, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Dante Alleghieri, St. Augustine, and countless 
  others. We must tell people that we are the torchbearers of this Great Idea. 
  We must argue that it is perhaps the single most important idea in all of human 
  history. And we should not be embarrassed to admit that our long-term mission 
  is to take it from idea to reality.<br>
