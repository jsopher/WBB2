It only took a few hours for planes to bring down two huge skyscrapers in New York City on September 11th, 2001. The fires went on for months. It took even longer to clean up the debris. Yet, it seems like it has taken the United States, and the world, three years, and will probably take decades more, to fully make sense of what happened. The shockwaves that emanted from those events have not quited down, and indeed may be ringing even louder, as we are constantly reminded of it, three years later. Are we healing yet? Are we responding appropriately? Do we fully understand what's going on? Have we found our strength through unity in diversity? These hard questions have no easy answers, but looking towards global unity might be a good place to start.<br>
<br>
The organization "We, the World," a New York organization whose goal is to raise more awareness in the public of the need for sustainability and peace, sponsored an event called "11 Days of Global Unity" from September 11th to September 21st, 2004. This included many forms of media to spread the message for global unity, with concerts, festivals, and broadcasting in 100 cities worldwide in 80 different countries, 40 of them in the US. We, the World worked in association with several organizations.<br>
<br>
11 Days closed with the event "Our Voices, Our World" in New York, which also happened to be on the UN International Day of Peace. This event featured presentations on how crucial it is to get involved in these issues at this time in history. Marianne Williamson spoke about building a Department of Peace and the relationship between spirituality and activism. Dr. Jane Goodall, noted for her anthropological studies of chimpanzee social behavior, as well as being an advocate for animal and human rights, released four giant peace doves that moved throughout the audience. And perhaps most importantly, Adotei Akwei, working with Amnesty International and others, provided information on how we can get involved. The event, <a href="http://www.WeTheWorld.org/sept21event">Our Voices, Our World</a>, was webcast live.<br>
<br> 
While we might not have reached any certainty regarding our ability to sustain peace and justice in the future, we can at least rest assured that there are many people in the world who deeply care and will not hesitate to spread the word.<br>
