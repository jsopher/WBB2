<br>
Petitions have been arriving in a flurry in my email in-box lately. I have some 
doubts about the effectiveness of all this petitioning and tend to be quick with 
the delete button, but one recent petition drew me in.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<br>
The message itself - which stated that the United Nations is collecting signatures 
of people opposed to a US invasion of Iraq - wasn't that different from the others 
that arrived that day. But I was intrigued by the long list of signatures, each 
with the hometown of the signer recorded. Signature by signature, I traced the 
petition's journey from friend to friend, from country to country. The trail crossed 
the Atlantic Ocean 14 times and the Pacific Ocean twice.<br>
<br>
The list of signers could have come right out of my daughters' bedtime tape. This 
is the one where Raffi - favorite minstrel of the pre-school set - says, "Now 
boys and girls you have a chance to hear a song about the names of people from 
around the world."<br>
<br>
Raffi could have picked any dozen names from this list and he would have his song:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Philippe comes from France, Tomas comes from Sweden, and Gonzolo comes from Ecuador.
<br>
Natalia comes from Chile, Marta comes from Spain, and John comes from America.
</blockquote>
<br>
Call me sappy if you want, or sentimental. Say I've been listening to too much 
Raffi and not enough nightly news. Say what you will, I think this list of names 
is beautiful. Seeing people - even just these few people - trying to come together 
and speak with one voice at the level of the whole globe fills me with hope.<br>
<br>
People know that peace is better than war, and - from Stockholm to Quito - a lot 
of us are looking for ways to say so together.<br>
<br>
We share only one atmosphere and a few oceans, and an awful lot of us understand 
the implications of that. We know that to steward a global resource we need global 
agreements, and global bodies to implement them. We know we must speak with one 
voice about climate, about water, about refugees, and about poverty.<br>
<br>
We are one people on one world and most of us know this, somewhere inside of ourselves, 
even when that is not what we have been taught, or what the people who govern 
us proclaim.<br>
<br>
Some of the astronauts, those who have viewed the Earth from space and tried to 
share the experience with the rest of us, say it most beautifully.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>You look down there and you can't imagine how many borders and boundaries you 
cross, again and again and again, and you don't even see them. There you are - 
hundreds of people in the Middle East killing each other over some imaginary line 
that you're not even aware of, that you can't see. And from where you see it, 
the thing is a whole, the earth is a whole, and it's so beautiful.</blockquote>
<br>
Those words - from Russell Schweickart who orbited Earth in 1969 - touch us not 
only because they were inspired by a journey to space, but also because we can 
feel their truth down here on the ground.<br>
<br>
So it does not surprise me that 521 people signed a petition to the UN. When you 
know, deep in your soul, that the earth is a beautiful whole and that people are 
one family, then sending a petition to a world body seems like a natural thing 
to do. You might not expect to change the course of human history, but it seems 
reasonable to expect that your signature as a citizen of the world will at least 
be noted somewhere.<br>
<br>
But, half an hour after I first opened the petition, a second message arrived 
from the sheepish colleague who had forwarded the petition in the first place. 
She'd learned that it was a hoax. She referred to the website of the UN Information 
Centre for more details, where I read the following:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>The UN is NOT involved in soliciting or collecting such petitions. We would suggest that since it is member governments of the UN who will decide on whatever action 
occurs in various situations, citizens should contact their own government.</blockquote>
<br>
Whoever wrote those few sentences is right, of course, at least for now. The UN 
does not represent people, only governments. There is no forum yet for the world's 
people to come together out of our sense that "the thing is a whole."<br>
<br>
But, whether we have organized ourselves yet or not, the thing is still a whole. 
We feel its wholeness as the climate changes. We feel its wholeness as the rage 
of the dispossessed in one part of the world lashes out at other people in other 
parts of the world. And we feel its wholeness as our children fall asleep to songs 
about the names of people from around the world.<br>
<br>
As the reality of the wholeness of our planet becomes harder to ignore, more and 
more of us are going to identify ourselves as citizens of the whole planet. More 
and more of us are going to be turning to something that we have yet to create 
- a government that can hear all of us, all of the people of a world that is whole.<br>
