  IRAN SEEK NUCLEAR WEAPONS?<i></i> <br>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">It now seems difficult to dispute 
  that the Iranian government is developing nuclear weapons, lying about it, and 
  intent on continuing both come hell or high water. Why? Because the temptation 
  for Iran to develop a nuclear arsenal of its own -- driven by the contradictions 
  of George Bush's foreign and nuclear policies -- is simply too seductive to 
  resist. <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, June 18th, the IAEA strongly rebuked Tehran , saying: " Iran 's cooperation 
  has not been as full, timely, and proactive as it should have been." The next 
  day Iran 's top nuclear official, Hassan Rowhani, objected bitterly to the IAEA's 
  statement, reiterated his insistence that Tehran 's nuclear program is intended 
  to generate electricity rather than warheads, and said that Tehran now would 
  resume some of the nuclear activities it had previously suspended. <br>
  <br>
  In addition, the chair of the Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign 
  Policy Committee, Ala'eddin Borujerdi, said the same day that the Majlis might 
  now reject the Additional Protocol to the NPT, which allows unannounced and 
  unfettered inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities. Under both international 
  and Iranian law, the Additional Protocol cannot take effect without Majlis approval. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, on Monday, June 21st, in a development difficult to believe wholly unrelated, 
  Iran seized 3 British naval vessels and 8 British sailors -- after Britain , 
  along with France and Germany , had spearheaded the IAEA censure.      <br>
  <br>
  Consider the outside world as viewed from Tehran . George Bush delivers his 
  2002 State of the Union address, and of all the countries in the world he singles 
  out three as constituting an "axis of evil." He announces his intent to instigate 
  unilateral preemptive war against any nation that his Administration subjectively 
  determines to be a potential threat. Defying almost universal world opinion, 
  he actually commences such a war against one of those three -- decapitating 
  its regime, killing the supreme leader's sons, and driving that leader himself 
  into a pathetic hole in the ground. And he surrounds Iran on all four sides 
  with bristling American military power -- Iraq to the west, Afghanistan to the 
  east, sprawling new American bases in the former Soviet republics of Central 
  Asia to the north, and the unchallengeable U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf to 
  the south. <br>
  <br>
  Iran , of course, cannot hope to take on the United States in any kind of direct 
  military confrontation. But it can aspire to deter what must seem to them to 
  be a quite real threat, someday, of American military aggression. How? By developing 
  the capability to inflict unacceptable catastrophic damage on American interests 
  or military forces abroad, on the American fleet in the Persian Gulf , or even 
  on the American homeland itself. And by holding out even the mere possibility 
  that it would respond to any American assault by employing that capability immediately, 
  before it became too late, following the traditional military maxim of "use 
  em or lose em." <br>
  <br>
  There is, of course, only one thing that can provide Iran with that kind of 
  deterrent capability. Hint: it's not nuclear electricity. <br>
  <br>
  It is probably the case that for Tehran the perceived danger of a U.S. invasion 
  is lower today than it might have been in 2002 or 2003. It is difficult to envision 
  any U.S. president in the foreseeable future launching another unilateral preemptive 
  first strike in the wake of the fiasco in Iraq . Imagine the political firestorm 
  -- even after a Bush reelection -- if the Administration began contemplating 
  another preemptive war, this time on Iran . <br>
  <br>
  But Tehran has no reason to believe that that shift in geostrategic dynamics 
  has become permanent. It has resulted, after all, from external circumstances 
  rather than from an internal American change of heart (or regime). On the contrary, 
  it probably provides the mullahs with all the more reason to press ahead, in 
  order to obtain the Great Deterrent before the Great Satan has a chance to regroup 
  and refocus. <br>
  <br>
  Looming over Iran 's immediate perception of American threat is the nuclear 
  double standard that so many other nations so resent. George Bush insists that 
  selected other countries have no right to possess nuclear weapons, while at 
  the same time making abundantly clear that we intend to retain thousands in 
  perpetuity. To the rest of the world this is sanctimonious and self-righteous, 
  suggesting that in our view we can be "trusted" with these weapons while others 
  cannot. Such a position is factually questionable. It is morally indefensible. 
  And it is utterly politically unsustainable. <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, June 21st, IAEA chief Mohamed El-Baradei delivered a blistering speech 
  blaming this posture for much of his difficulty stemming nuclear proliferation 
  in Iran and elsewhere. The time has come, he said, to "abandon the unworkable 
  notion that it is morally reprehensible for some countries to pursue nuclear 
  weapons but morally acceptable for others to rely on them." <br>
  <br>
  This is especially true when the original Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) 
  is understood in its original context. The NPT was not just a framework to prevent 
  the spread of nuclear weapons. It was, instead, a grand bargain -- where the 
  great many "nuclear have-nots" agreed to forego nuclear weapons while the few 
  "nuclear haves" agreed eventually to get rid of theirs. Moreover, the United 
  States recommitted itself to this covenant at the 30-year NPT Review Conference 
  in spring 2000, where the NPT's nuclear signatories pledged "an unequivocal 
  undertaking . to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals." 
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Bush Administration, rather than moving toward total elimination, is 
  instead pursuing perpetual possession. Its Strangelovian nuclear war fighting 
  posture contains plans for bunker busting "mini-nukes" -- an oxymoron if there 
  ever was one. (Just this June 15th the U.S. Senate -- in a move probably not 
  unnoticed in Tehran -- endorsed new funding to study the development of such 
  weapons.) It broadens the scope of military scenarios in which the U.S. might 
  actually initiate a nuclear first-strike. It envisions new generations of strategic 
  nuclear missiles in 2020, 2030, and 2040! Yet it says not one word about any 
  "unequivocal undertaking" toward abolition. <br>
  <br>
  It is not just Tehran that, in all likelihood, is violating the NPT by pursuing 
  a nuclear weapon capability. It is also Washington that is violating the NPT 
  -- by insisting on retaining our own nuclear weapon capability apparently for 
  time everlasting. <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month the Bush Administration announced plans to reduce our active 
  nuclear inventory to no more than 2200 by 2012 (though thousands more would 
  still be maintained "in reserve"). This would place us in compliance with the 
  Moscow Treaty of 2002. But it would do almost nothing to reduce the actual dangers 
  posed by nuclear weapons today. How does simple bean counting reduce the risk 
  of nuclear terror, or a fatal nuclear miscalculation in a hot political crisis, 
  or accidental atomic apocalypse? (Nuclear weapons, after all, are the prototypical 
  example of the adage: "it only takes just one.") Why don't the Moscow Treaty 
  or the latest plan say anywhere that these reductions are part of a larger vision, 
  to be followed by further steps toward zero? How does an intention to reduce 
  our nuclear inventory to 2200 by 2012 make Iran feel safer today (or, for that 
  matter, in 2012)? <br>
  <br>
  Sadly for both the principles of the Democratic Party and the prospects for 
  nuclear non-proliferation, Senator John Kerry has also conspicuously failed 
  to question the nuclear status quo. He did release a plan to safeguard nuclear 
  materials and reduce the risk of nuclear terror on June 1st, calling it his 
  "number one security goal." But while his plan said a great deal about nuclear 
  weapons and nuclear materials in the hands of "shadowy figures," it said very 
  little about those in the hands of ourselves. <br>
  <br>
  Kerry did condemn Bush's mini-nuke initiative. But it is one thing to oppose 
  the development of new types of nuclear weapons, another to put the thousands 
  we already possess on the table. Candidate Kerry may have grand plans to reduce 
  the threat of nuclear terror. But he apparently has no plans to confront what 
  can only be called America 's nuclear hypocrisy. <br>
  <br>
  The paradox of such an American nuclear posture is that the one country most 
  insistent about retaining its nuclear weapons is the one country that needs 
  them the least. The paramount geostrategic reality of the early 21st Century 
  is America 's unchallengeable conventional military superiority over any conceivable 
  combination of adversaries. Iran needs nuclear weapons to be able to inflict 
  unacceptable catastrophic damage on a potential aggressor -- and thereby hopefully 
  deter any potential aggression. But Washington , unlike anyone else, can inflict 
  unacceptable catastrophic damage on any country in the world with our conventional 
  capabilities alone. If any country can deter any attack and repel any enemy 
  without resorting to an atomic arsenal, it is us. <br>
  <br>
  Our nuclear weapons, in fact, are worse than useless for the real threats to 
  Americans at the dawn of the 21st Century. Our armies and air forces didn't 
  protect us on 9/11. Our 13 aircraft carrier battle groups (no other country 
  has even one) didn't protect us on 9/11. And the thing that protected us the 
  least on 9/11 was our bloated nuclear stockpile, our arsenal of the apocalypse. 
  What could a single nuclear warhead have done to stop Mohammed Atta, or to have 
  apprehended him, or even to have deterred him? How can all our nuclear bombers 
  and missiles and submarines put together prevent some odious creature from smuggling 
  a single nuclear warhead into an American city, and committing the greatest 
  act of mass murder in all of human history? <br>
  <br>
  Nuclear weapons pollute the psyche with the arrogance of insuperable power. 
  They create delusions of domination. With their calculations of mass casualties, 
  they dehumanize our adversaries ... and consequently ourselves. And in the age 
  of American hyperpower, they provide American decisionmakers with very few additional 
  policy options or political/military benefits. Yet their costs and risks approach 
  the infinite. <br>
  <br>
  As Jonathan Schell has persuasively argued, the great irony of the Bush era 
  is that both the Iraq war specifically and the preemption doctrine generally 
  were supposed to be directed at curtailing the proliferation of weapons of mass 
  destruction. Instead, in all likelihood, they have exacerbated -- in both frequency 
  and intensity -- the quest by others to acquire them. Isaac Newton's laws of 
  action and reaction do not apply solely to billiard balls. George Bush's greatest 
  historical legacy may be the phenomenon of self-fulfilling prophecy. <br>
  <br>
  It is difficult not to conclude that the foreign policies and nuclear weapons 
  policies of the Bush Administration, far from reducing the WMD danger, are instead 
  leading us on a downward spiral toward immediate nuclear proliferation and eventual 
  nuclear disaster. The only long-term choice is between a world of many dozen 
  nuclear weapon states -- where the detonation of a nuclear warhead in some great 
  city of the world will become only a matter of time -- or a world of zero nuclear 
  weapon states. The United States can state unambiguously that we intend to walk 
  down an irreversible path toward the light of a nuclear weapon free world. Or 
  we can expect Iran and many others to join us on the road to a darker destination.
