<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In times of great crisis, opposites 
  often arise together in pristine purity. Unleash a great evil in one place, 
  and its nemesis arises somewhere else. Knock a dying paradigm off the world 
  stage, and a new one kicks up out of the blue.<br>
  <br>
  But there's one other requirement: On its way out, the old model leaves behind 
  an isolated but crucial truth, one that the new paradigm must incorporate if 
  it is to be a genuine advance. The Bush administration, representing the last 
  gasp of imperialist unilateralism in an interdependent world, is perversely 
  teaching us one such isolated truth: that firm enforcement of international 
  law is needed in a dangerous world.<br>
  <br>
  In his ultimatum speech, Bush's Orwellian speechwriters dubbed our invasion 
  of Iraq as "enforcement of the just demands of the world." Of course, most of 
  us know better about Bush's brazen international antics, but the President is 
  teaching us a cruel and bitter lesson about how to achieve a world without war 
  and terrorism. The emerging new model, he is showing us, must incorporate the 
  concept of decisive enforcement of global law. But in the new model, law enforcement 
  must be embedded in the context of a genuine global democracy--a global governing 
  structure that represents the will and reflects the sovereignty of the world's 
  people.(1)<br>
  <br>
  Let me put it another way. Right now in our face, Bush's horrifying abuse of 
  the high principle of international law enforcement is calling forth its pristine 
  opposite: The need for a genuine global legislature that can pass enforceable 
  global laws, binding legislation that can be applied by a global executive branch 
  and interpreted by duly appointed world courts--supported by a world constitution 
  that jealously guards individual and national rights. And the first planks of 
  this constitution will be the abolition of war between nations and the binding 
  adjudication of international disputes and criminal acts by legitimate world 
  courts. The first imperative of world civilization is to outlaw murder of all 
  kinds across national boundaries, and to use legitimate force to hold individual 
  lawbreakers--and not entire nations like Iraq--accountable before legitimate 
  standards of world justice.<br>
  <br>
  As I see it, the choice is stark: The force of law applied against individuals 
  in a governed world, or the law of force applied against whole countries in 
  a world of lawless anarchy--take your pick.(2)<br>
  <br>
  I witnessed a case in point, which I want to share with you as we embark on 
  our catastrophe in Iraq. By all accounts, the Bush administration had descended 
  in the last week before the war into an unprecedented diplomatic chaos. One 
  typical commentator, presidential candidate Senator John Kerry, called it "some 
  of the weakest diplomacy in the history of the nation." The New York Times called 
  it "a terrible diplomatic failure." But at the height of Bush's diplomatic delirium, 
  what is arguably the very best moment in global diplomatic history occurred-the 
  seating of the 18 justices at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the 
  Hague. This happy development is the mirror opposite of what Bush is now foisting 
  on the world. It was fascinating to me how it presented itself at the lowest 
  point of Bush's chaotic diplomatic frenzy in and around the UN Security Council.<br>
  <br>
  Although opposed with a vengeance at all points by the Bush administration, 
  the ICC is as of March 11, 2003 officially inaugurated. It is now an operational 
  reality. These 18 justices were elected by the 90 or so signatories of the historic 
  1998 Rome Treaty. Remember that particular embarrassment? That's the statue 
  creating the ICC that President Clinton signed in the final hours of his administration, 
  which Bush "unsigned" last May, not long before he announced his intention to 
  unilaterally attack Iraq without UN sanction.<br>
  <br>
  Here it was, the one institution that could deploy the existing (albeit weak) 
  instruments of international law to bring the likes of Saddam Hussein before 
  the bar of world justice, and Bush was trying to derail it. Russia and China 
  balked at signing this treaty, now known as the Rome Statute, but the US actively 
  tried to block the court's creation up until the moment last April when the 
  treaty was ratified by the required number of signatories. No way, the Americans 
  said! We were going to enforce our own idea of world law, on our own selfish 
  terms, and with that manly Texas mettle that knows best.<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Bush set his Undersecretary of State John Bolton to work strong-arming 
  countries into agreeing to exempt US citizens from the ICC's purview. The Republicans 
  in Congress followed suit by pushing through the stupid (there is no other word 
  for it) American Servicemember's Protection Act. But in the end the Bush administration's 
  varied attempts to stop the launch of the ICC did not work. And last week they 
  were morally upstaged by the event at the Hague, where 11 men and seven women--selected 
  from a list of the world's finest jurists--were honored at a gala presided over 
  by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. The inaugural ceremony was attended by 
  foreign ministers and international diplomats from 100 countries-and of course 
  was totally absent of representatives from the U.S.<br>
  <br>
  There is much to adjudicate: There are already plenty of cases on the docket 
  for the ICC to begin reviewing and investigating. And to my Republican and libertarian 
  friends who fear that the ICC is based on legal principles inferior to the US 
  Constitution and Bill of Rights, have a look at this point-by-point comparison 
  put together by Washington Working Group on the International Criminal Court:

  </a><br>
  Other elements of the emerging global governance paradigm are showing up too, 
  again, seemingly out of the blue and just in time to refute the doomsdayers 
  and cynics among us. The pristine beginnings of world democracy--the innocent 
  and fresh voice of the sovereignty of the world's people--a voice that can become 
  one part of the legitimate underpinnings of a global democratic federal government, 
  has been showing up in the massive peace demonstrations around the world. I 
  would suggest that it is on that basis that one can elevate a vision of a radical 
  expansion of the goals of the peace movement. This nascent peace and justice 
  movement, which first showed its strength and diversity at the Seattle demonstrations 
  against the WTO in 1999, should go beyond its mere antiwar or anti-imperialist 
  sentiments; it should move toward the advocacy of a true global democracy under 
  enforceable global law. There is no other sane or realistic way to global peace 
  and justice.<br>
  <br>
  Today's misguided peace movement is largely marked by a naive utopianism that 
  confuses human nature with angelic nature. Angels can live in peace without 
  law and government--humans can't. Yes, of course, "world peace" is a wonderful 
  ideal, and war is a great calamity. But peace without justice is an illusion--a 
  sort of truce until the next war comes along (e.g., the intractable Israeli-Palestinian 
  stalemate). And justice, too, is unachievable without the just establishment 
  of law by elected legislatures along with juridical institutions to apply the 
  law. And juridical institutions are almost useless without enforcement mechanisms--the 
  impotence of the UN is a case in point of course. On the international level, 
  all this means, again, enforceable global law.<br>
  <br>
  Peace requires justice, and justice rests on legitimate and enforceable law. 
  Only when the peace movement understands this crucial syllogism, and only when 
  international businessmen learn that global commerce is impossible without enforceable 
  global law based on true planetary democracy, we will have an end to unjust 
  wars like the one we are now fighting. Only then will there be an end to the 
  evil adventurism of the American imperium and a genuine solution to terrorism. 
  Only then can we really tackle the daunting problems of global pollution and 
  grinding poverty.<br>
  <br>
  A day will come, I have faith, when we will no longer need the George Bushes 
  and the Saddam Husseins of the world to teach us their increasingly bloody and 
  increasingly obvious lessons about how justice and peace are achieved on an 
  all-too-human planet. To do it we will need enforceable global law--the crystallization 
  of brotherly love on a planetary scale.<br>

  <font size="1">FOOTNOTES<br>
  <br>
  (1) The people of the world are the true sovereign of the planet, inherently; 
  and each world citizen born on this planet possesses God-given inalienable rights 
  inhering in their very personhood. The question for the 21st century becomes: 
  Who represents that sovereignty? Who can legitimately protect human rights at 
  the global level? And who is the true upholder and enforcer of global peace 
  and justice?<br>
  <br>
  (2) The final stage of the insane logic of the latter strategy is Bush's plan 
  for the weaponization of space.<br>

  RESOURCES FOR A GOVERNED WORLD<br>
  <br>
  1. Some years ago, just before the fall of the USSR, I wrote, directed, and 
  coproduced a 28 minute educational video about the concepts discussed in this 
  essay. It is entitled "Toward a Governed World." Norman Cousins said, "the film 
  is done with high professionalism and is as rewarding as it is important." I 
  have dusted this off and am making copies available tonight for the first time 
  in ten years for $15, including shipping cost and tax. (Sliding scale pricing 
  for students or people on limited budgets.) Just email me your address and I 
  will send you a copy with a bill.<br>
