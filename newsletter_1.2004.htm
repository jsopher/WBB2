  1. QUOTE OF THE MONTH<br>
  <br>
  "There is hopeful symbolism in the fact that flags do not wave in a vacuum." 
  --Arthur C. Clarke<br>
  <br>
  --------------<br>
  2. WHAT'S NEW AT WORLD BEYOND BORDERS<br>
  <br>
  Many great athletes will tell you that imagining victory before a big game helps 
  their performance on the field. Filmmaking also uses a visioning process during 
  pre-production. Every aspect of a film must be drawn out in storyboard form 
  before any shooting begins. This month at World Beyond Borders, we'd like to 
  announce the creation of Terran Times - a newspaper from the year 2100. This 
  is a means for us to imagine a brighter future of global unity, which will in 
  turn help us think about the successive steps that must be taken to get us there. 
  Terran Times is a wiki, a collaborative website anyone can edit. So get creative 
  in the new year and help us imagine what living in a united world will be like. 
  Terran Times is located at <a href="http://worldbeyondborders.freezope.org/terrantimes" target="_blank">http://worldbeyondborders.freezope.org/terrantimes</a>.<br>
  <br>
  We would also like to announce an extension for our Earth Flag and Anthem Contest. 
  We want to encourage more entries, so the new deadline is July 1st, 2004.<br>
  <br>
  New articles this month are as follows:<br>
  <br>
  How We Might Get There?<br>
  *"The Engagement Tree Model" by Jane Shevtsov looks at why people get involved 
  in causes and organizations. How can we engage them on the deep level necessary 
  for our long-term work? <br>
  (<a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/engagementtree.htm">www.worldbeyondborders.org/engagementtree.htm</a>)<br>
  <br>
  *"Space and Human Unity" by Jane Shevtsov discusses the connection between space 
  exploration and perceptions of human unity. "Congressman Bill Nelson, who also 
  flew on the shuttle, has put forward the idea of a summit meeting in space. 
  Perhaps that is where Earth's constitution will be written." <br>
  (<a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/spaceunity.htm">www.worldbeyondborders.org/spaceunity.htm</a>)<br>

  3. SPACE, SPIRIT AND UNITY<br>
  by Jane Shevtsov<br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the lander Spirit touched down on Mars. Over its projected lifetime 
  of three months, it will explore Gustav Crater, a region of Mars thought to 
  have contained liquid water in the past. People from all over the world will 
  see the photos it sends back. These images will have tremendous scientific value 
  and the lander's experiments may shed light on the possibility of past life 
  on Mars. Yet, there is one more thing Spirit could do before its mission is 
  out. It could take a look back at the Earth.<br>
  <br>
  Pictures of Earth from Mars have been taken before. They, however, used powerful 
  magnification to produce a recognizable disk, sometimes even with visible continents. 
  Clearly, this is not what someone standing on Mars would see. From the red planet, 
  Earth will appear to be a pale blue dot, just as Mars is a pale red dot in the 
  skies of Earth. Earth will not even be the brightest planet in the Martian sky 
  -- that distinction goes to Venus, which is farther away from Mars than Earth 
  but reflects far more of the sunlight hitting it.<br>
  <br>
  Future astronauts traveling to Mars will be the first human beings to see this 
  sight with their own eyes. They will witness what Carl Sagan wrote of when he 
  described a snapshot of Earth taken -- with high magnification -- from beyond 
  the orbit of the outermost planet. "That's here. That's home. That's us. On 
  it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human 
  being who ever was, lived out their lives... The Earth is a very small stage 
  in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals 
  and emperors, so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary 
  masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the 
  inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants 
  of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are 
  to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds."<br>
  <br>
  The more of us share this perspective, the closer we will come to seeing ourselves 
  as human beings first and foremost and the closer we'll come to building a global 
  government. It would be a fitting irony if Mars, named after the Roman god of 
  war, helped bring an end to it on Earth.<br>

  4. WHAT YOU CAN DO<br>
  <br>
  *Share the short article above or the longer "Space and Human Unity" article 
  with a space enthusiast friend -- or anyone watching Spirit's new images. Consider 
  using it to bring up the topic of democratic global government.<br>
  <br>
  *Send this newsletter to two people you would not normally <br>
  forward it to. Let's get out of our usual clusters this month!<br>
