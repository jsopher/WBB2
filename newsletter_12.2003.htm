  1. QUOTE OF THE MONTH<br>
  <br>
  "Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood and <br>
  probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in <br>
  hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded <br>
  will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, <br>
  asserting itself with ever-growing insistency." --Daniel Burnham, <br>
  architect of first skyscraper, 1864-1912<br>

  2. WHAT'S NEW AT WORLD BEYOND BORDERS <br>
  <br>
  One of the purposes of World Beyond Borders is to empower on-the-ground activists 
  by providing information and resources. This month, we are introducing two new 
  features we hope will help you. The first is a new mailing list for World Beyond 
  Borders participants -- people working to promote human unity, world citizenship 
  and global government. Some belong to organized groups; others do not. All can 
  use this list to share ideas, coordinate projects, discuss results and support 
  one another. To subscribe, send a blank email to <br>
  <a href="mailto:wbbaction-subscribe@topica.com">wbbaction-subscribe@topica.com</a>.<br>
  <br>
  Our second new feature is a Projects section in Interactive Activities and Communication. 
  This is where you get to toot your own horn. Tell us about any cool projects 
  you're working on or have completed in the past. We're interested in everything 
  from small, local accomplishments to national and international campaigns. Send 
  your stories, long or short, to Jane Shevtsov, <a href="mailto:jaia@ucla.edu">jaia@ucla.edu</a>.<br>
  <br>
  We also have two new articles. By section, they are:<br>
  <br>
  Why Global Government?<br>
  <a href="mythologyendingallwar.htm">*"The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings: 
  A Mythology of Ending All War" by Eli Williamson-Jones</a> looks at movies that 
  have become modern myths. What do these films tell us about our society and 
  about ending war?<br>
  <br>
  What Might It Look Like?<br>
  <a href="anatomyofpeace.htm">*"The Anatomy of Peace: Conventional Constitutional 
  Conservatism" by Alexander Madison Fleming</a>. The author has been Professor 
  of Earth Politics at the University of New Washington at Mars North (UNWMN) 
  since 2185. He was Chair of the United Earth Centennial Committee (2169) and 
  served on the New Mars Union constitutional committee (2179-80).<br>

  3. BAD NEWS FOR THE OZONE LAYER<br>
  <br>
  by Eli Williamson-Jones<br>
  <br>
  Last month, talks between the United States and the rest of the world concerning 
  the Montreal Protocol broke down in Nairobi, Kenya. The Montreal Protocol is 
  a treaty that curtails the world's use of ozone-depleting chemicals, most famously 
  CFCs but also the even more destructive pesticide methyl bromide. The Bush administration 
  is threatening to ignore the treaty's provisions if its demands for higher usage 
  of the chemical are not sanctioned. Even after the European Union offered a 
  compromise that would provide farmers with the same amounts of the pesticide 
  as they had used a year earlier, delegates from the U.S. refused. Apparently 
  this wasn't enough for the nation which already accounts for a quarter of the 
  world's use of the chemical. <br>
  <br>
  It has been argued that the Bush administration is moving forward with such 
  environmentally hostile actions in order to win the electoral vote of Florida 
  which is desperately needed in a reelection. Strawberry growers in Florida are 
  consequently large users of methyl bromide and may not support Bush if they 
  can't continue using the pesticide. <br>
  <br>
  Although the ozone hole is expected to heal in about fifty years, scientists 
  say that the danger to the ozone layer persists. As a result of the dissonance 
  created over the Montreal Protocol in Nairobi, another meeting will be held 
  in Montreal, Canada during March 24th through the 26th of next year. The question 
  is how the world community will deal with the threat to the ozone layer that 
  protects us and the treaty that protects the ozone layer. <br>

  4. WHAT YOU CAN DO<br>
  <br>
  *Forward this newsletter. That's one of the most effective ways to promote World 
  Beyond Borders, so send it to at least two people. <br>
  <br>
  *Talk with a friend about the ozone article above. You can use it to bring up 
  the question of enforceability. If countries can break treaties as they please, 
  what good are treaties? We need true world law to protect Earth.<br>
  <br>
  *Make a New Year's resolution. (For those of you outside the US, a New Year's 
  resolution is something people commit to doing in the new year.) Think about 
  what it means to live as a global citizen and choose a resolution -- or five! 
  Can you come up with creative ways to promote World Beyond Borders and the idea 
  of global government? What can you do to make the whole world a better place? 
  Make your resolutions realistic and measurable -- and tell us about them!<br>
