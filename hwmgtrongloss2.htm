  for the "Day of the School" at the Universal Congress of Esperanto,<br>
  Gothenburg, Sweden, 29 July 2003<br>
  <br>
  "Why should we learn Esperanto?" Of course, the answer is not the same for each 
  person.Furthermore, there are different kinds of reasons. I want to discuss 
  these various reasons under three headings. The three kinds of reasons are (1) 
  the practical reasons, (2) the reasons related to expanding one's mind, and 
  (3) the moral reasons.<br>
  <br>
  The first practical reason which I want to mention is to enjoy yourself. By 
  means of Esperanto you can meet and become acquainted with many good-hearted, 
  interesting, educated, clever, talented persons. You can travel to various countries 
  throughout the world. You can participate in truly international parties. You 
  can hear music and join in dancing the dances of many cultures. The whole planet 
  can become your playground.<br>
  <br>
  The second practical reason is to have like-minded friends (some of whom you 
  have not even previously met) who will greet you and welcome you anywhere in 
  the world. Sometimes they will even invite you to eat with them and stay in 
  their homes in far-off lands. As Esperantists often say, "If you want to gain 
  money, study English; but if you want to have friends, learn Esperanto." Undoubtedly 
  it is a true saying that Esperantists have good friends everywhere. Beyond that, 
  don't forget that sometimes Esperantists even find a husband or a wife as a 
  result of belonging to the Esperanto community.<br>
  <br>
  The third practical reason for learning Esperanto, especially for children in 
  English-speaking and Asian lands, is that Esperanto provides a good way of beginning 
  the study of a language other than your native tongue. Various experiments show 
  that pupils learn the rule-guided language Esperanto more rapidly than European 
  national languages such as English and French. Furthermore, one can observe 
  that pupils who first study Esperanto instead of more difficult languages are 
  afterwards more eager to learn still other languages. They feel confident that 
  they have the capability to do that. On the contrary, the study of more difficult 
  languages like Latin and English often discourages pupils from trying to learn 
  other languages.<br>
  <br>
  Let me turn now to the second kind of reason for studying Esperanto, namely, 
  to expand your mind in order to have a better understanding of the world. As 
  Canadian Esperantist Dr. Stevens Norvell of Nova Scotia rightly notes, Esperanto 
  is "a window to the world." When you are able to read and hear Esperanto, you 
  can use it to become informed about other countries, other cultures, and other 
  viewpoints through books, newspapers, magazines, sound-tapes, videotapes, radio 
  and television broadcasts, web-sites, and web-messages. You can acquire information 
  from a neutral point of view about what is happening throughout the whole world.<br>
  <br>
  Furthermore, it is not only specific information which you can acquire. You 
  will also gain a better general understanding of the world. You will no longer 
  be so tied by language to one small region of the Earth and the viewpoint of 
  that language or cultural community. You can become acquainted with the whole 
  human community.<br>
  <br>
  The third kind of reason to learn Esperanto is for me personally the most important. 
  It is the moral reason, and it has two sides.<br>
  <br>
  First, you can have a relationship with other persons throughout the world on 
  the basis of equality and justice because you are using the world-wide neutral 
  language Esperanto instead of your own national language. You will not require 
  others to use your language, and they will not require you to use their language. 
  Consequently there exists a feeling of equality and justice between you and 
  others. <br>
  <br>
  The second aspect of the moral kind of reason for learning Esperanto is the 
  fact that, as an Esperantist, you are helping to create an evolving harmonious 
  global community. Through Esperanto you become part of an important historical 
  movement which promotes a sense of solidarity among all humans. Esperanto is 
  not only a language. We Esperantists constitute a totally new kind of universal 
  community based on the use of our global language. We together are now moving 
  beyond the inter-nationalism of the twentieth century to the globalism of the 
  twenty-first century. Nevertheless, at the same time we are helping to conserve 
  the many national languages in the various parts of the world, thus preserving 
  linguistic diversity.<br>
  <br>
  Undoubtedly there are other reasons for learning Esperanto which I have not 
  mentioned. The situations and motives of humans are very diverse. Nevertheless 
  I hope that the ideas which I have presented here will help you to persuade 
  others that they should learn Esperanto and become members of our evolving global 
  community.</font></p>
