Four articles on borders and the environment -- one on the Korean Demilitarized Zone, one on the US-Mexico border, one on natural borders and one in immigration -- arrived in my mailbox within two weeks in November. To me, the common thread running through all these articles is the need to make our mental maps of the world more flexible if we are to deal effectively with environmental problems. In this article, I will propose a few tentative ideas for doing so. Please comment!<br>
<br>
Natural boundaries are gradual. Going from forest to prairie or from chapparal to desert, one is never quite sure where one ends and the other begins. Such boundaries, called ecotones, often have very high biodiversity, supporting many species from both bordering ecosystems and some found only in the ecotone. Border areas have the potential to become fertile cultural ecotones, but instead of respecting such places, we militarize them. We restrict people's movements as though it was the most natural thing in the world. But things could be different. Can you imagine a world with fuzzy, nonrestrictive boundaries? What would it look like? How might it function?<br>
<br>
In such a world, migration would be easier than today. To some, this raises environmental concerns. Those environmentalists who want to restrict immigration typically justify their stance by saying that America is overpopulated. Some mean that America has a disproportionate impact on the global environment, which is certainly true. However, others just say that immigration damages the American environment. They're certainly not the only ones using that term; however, to speak of "the American environment" as anything other than a geographic and political convenience implies fundamental confusion of imagination and reality.<br>
<br>
Nature follows its own boundaries and these do not coincide with political ones. There are any number of American environments, to be classified according to one's needs. If studying biomes, you distinguish between forest, prairie and chapparal. For other purposes, you can say that a place is urban, rural, east of the Mississippi, west of the Rockies, above the treeline. Unlike "American", "Canadian" or "Mexican", these designations are physically and biologically meaningful. Thoughtfully applied, they could create a greater role for sub-national governments in handling issues such as immigration.<br>
<br>
It is not enough to say that different issues need to be dealt with on different levels. Sometimes, different units on approximately the same level may be needed. It would make little sense to set gun control policy within watershed units and just as little sense to set water policy within state or county units, as we frequently do. To avoid making things overly complicated, you could have representatives elected in districts the way they are now. When working on, say, a watershed issue, each representative would have a vote proportional to the area their district covers in the watershed. When working on an issue for which lingustic units make sense, they could do the same thing.<br>
<br>
We can begin to respect natural boundaries within countries, particularly large ones. However, as long as nation-states dominate our lives, establishing fuzzy boundaries or cross-border political units will be difficult or impossible. A full flowering of natural units in politics must await a global government.
