Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth, men do not easily   assume the task of opposing their government's policy, especially in time of   war. Nor does the human spirit move without great difficulty against all the   apathy of conformist thought within one's own bosom and in the surrounding world.   Moreover when the issues at hand seem as perplexed as they often do in the case   of this dreadful conflict we are always on the verge of being mesmerized by   uncertainty; but we must move on.<br>  <br>  Some of us who have already begun to break the silence of the night have found   that the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony, but we must speak. We   must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision,   but we must speak. And we must rejoice as well, for surely this is the first   time in our nation's history that a significant number of its religious leaders   have chosen to move beyond the prophesying of smooth patriotism to the high   grounds of a firm dissent based upon the mandates of conscience and the reading   of history. Perhaps a new spirit is rising among us. If it is, let us trace   its movement well and pray that our own inner being may be sensitive to its   guidance, for we are deeply in need of a new way beyond the darkness that seems   so close around us...<br>  <br>  As if the weight of such a commitment to the life and health of America were   not enough, another burden of responsibility was placed upon me in 1964; and   I cannot forget that the Nobel Prize for Peace was also a commission -- a commission   to work harder than I had ever worked before for "the brotherhood of man." This   is a calling that takes me beyond national allegiances, but even if it were   not present I would yet have to live with the meaning of my commitment to the   ministry of Jesus Christ. To me the relationship of this ministry to the making   of peace is so obvious that I sometimes marvel at those who ask me why I am   speaking against the war. Could it be that they do not know that the good news   was meant for all men -- for Communist and capitalist, for their children and   ours, for black and for white, for revolutionary and conservative? Have they   forgotten that my ministry is in obedience to the one who loved his enemies   so fully that he died for them? What then can I say to the "Vietcong" or to   Castro or to Mao as a faithful minister of this one? Can I threaten them with   death or must I not share with them my life?<br>  <br>  This I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who deem ourselves   bound by allegiances and loyalties which are broader and deeper than nationalism   and which go beyond our nation's self-defined goals and positions. We are called   to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for victims of our nation and for   those it calls enemy, for no document from human hands can make these humans   any less our brothers...<br>  <br>  It is with such activity in mind that the words of the late John F. Kennedy   come back to haunt us. Five years ago he said, "Those who make peaceful revolution   impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."<br>  <br>  Increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our nation has taken   -- the role of those who make peaceful revolution impossible by refusing to   give up the privileges and the pleasures that come from the immense profits   of overseas investment.<br>  <br>  I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution,   we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly   begin the shift from a "thing-oriented" society to a "person-oriented" society.   When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered   more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism   are incapable of being conquered.<br>  <br>  A true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and   justice of many of our past and present policies. n the one hand we are called   to play the good Samaritan on life's roadside; but that will be only an initial   act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho road must be transformed   so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make   their journey on life's highway. True compassion is more than flinging a coin   to a beggar; it is not haphazard and superficial. It comes to see that an edifice   which produces beggars needs restructuring. A true revolution of values will   soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous   indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of   the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only   to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries,   and say: "This is not just." It will look at our alliance with the landed gentry   of Latin America and say: "This is not just." The Western arrogance of feeling   that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not   just. A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say   of war: "This way of settling differences is not just." This business of burning   human beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows,   of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of people normally humane, of   sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and   psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.   A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense   than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.<br>  <br>  America, the richest and most powerful nation in the world, can well lead the   way in this revolution of values. There is nothing, except a tragic death wish,   to prevent us from reordering our priorities, so that the pursuit of peace will   take precedence over the pursuit of war. There is nothing to keep us from molding   a recalcitrant status quo with bruised hands until we have fashioned it into   a brotherhood.<br>  <br>  This kind of positive revolution of values is our best defense against communism.   War is not the answer. Communism will never be defeated by the use of atomic   bombs or nuclear weapons. Let us not join those who shout war and through their   misguided passions urge the United States to relinquish its participation in   the United Nations. These are days which demand wise restraint and calm reasonableness.   We must not call everyone a Communist or an appeaser who advocates the seating   of Red China in the United Nations and who recognizes that hate and hysteria   are not the final answers to the problem of these turbulent days. We must not   engage in a negative anti-communism, but rather in a positive thrust for democracy,   realizing that our greatest defense against communism is to take offensive action   in behalf of justice. We must with positive action seek to remove thosse conditions   of poverty, insecurity and injustice which are the fertile soil in which the   seed of communism grows and develops...<br>  <br>  These are revolutionary times. All over the globe men are revolting against   old systems of exploitation and oppression and out of the wombs of a frail world   new systems of justice and equality are being born. The shirtless and barefoot   people of the land are rising up as never before. "The people who sat in darkness   have seen a great light." We in the West must support these revolutions. It   is a sad fact that, because of comfort, complacency, a morbid fear of communism,   and our proneness to adjust to injustice, the Western nations that initiated   so much of the revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the   arch anti-revolutionaries. This has driven many to feel that only Marxism has   the revolutionary spirit. Therefore, communism is a judgement against our failure   to make democracy real and follow through on the revolutions we initiated. Our   only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and   go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty,   racism, and militarism. With this powerful commitment we shall boldly challenge   the status quo and unjust mores and thereby speed the day when "every valley   shall be exalted, and every moutain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked   shall be made straight and the rough places plain."<br>  <br>  A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties   must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Every nation must now develop   an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in   their individual societies.<br>  <br>  This call for a world-wide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one's   tribe, race, class and nation is in reality a call for an all-embracing and   unconditional love for all men. This oft misunderstood and misinterpreted concept   -- so readily dismissed by the Nietzsches of the world as a weak and cowardly   force -- has now become an absolute necessity for the survival of man. When   I speak of love I am not speaking of some sentimental and weak response. I am   speaking of that force which all of the great religions have seen as the supreme   unifying principle of life. Love is somehow the key that unlocks the door which   leads to ultimate reality. This Hindu-Moslem-Christian-Jewish-Buddhist belief   about ultimate reality is beautifully summed up in the first epistle of Saint   John:<br>  <br>  Let us love one another; for love is God and everyone that loveth is born of   God and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. If   we love one another God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.<br>  <br>  Let us hope that this spirit will become the order of the day. We can no longer   afford to worship the god of hate or bow before the altar of retaliation. The   oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever-rising tides of hate. History   is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this   self-defeating path of hate. As Arnold Toynbee says: "Love is the ultimate force   that makes for the saving choice of life and good against the damning choice   of death and evil. Therefore the first hope in our inventory must be the hope   that love is going to have the last word."<br>  <br>  We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with   the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history there   is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time.   Life often leaves us standing bare, naked and dejected with a lost opportunity.   The "tide in the affairs of men" does not remain at the flood; it ebbs. We may   cry out deperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is deaf to every   plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residue of numerous   civilizations are written the pathetic words: "Too late." There is an invisible   book of life that faithfully records our vigilance or our neglect. "The moving   finger writes, and having writ moves on..." We still have a choice today; nonviolent   coexistence or violent co-annihilation.<br>  <br>  We must move past indecision to action. We must find new ways to speak for peace   in Vietnam and justice throughout the developing world -- a world that borders   on our doors. If we do not act we shall surely be dragged down the long dark   and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess power without   compassion, might without morality, and strength without sight. Now let us begin.   Now let us rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter -- but beautiful -- struggle   for a new world. This is the callling of the sons of God, and our brothers wait   eagerly for our response. Shall we say the odds are too great? Shall we tell   them the struggle is too hard? Will our message be that the forces of American   life militate against their arrival as full men, and we send our deepest regrets?   Or will there be another message, of longing, of hope, of solidarity with their   yearnings, of commitment to their cause, whatever the cost? The choice is ours,   and though we might prefer it otherwise we must choose in this crucial moment   of human history...<br>  <br>  <font size="1"><br>  Martin Luther King, Jr. was perhaps America's greatest civil rights leaders   of the twentieth century. Though always conscious of the possibility of death,   King was steadfastly dedicated to nonviolence because of its power over violence.   Speaking on August 28, 1963, from the Lincoln Memorial, he began the litany   that would sound in the hearts of every listener: He dreamed of that day, he   said, when "my four little children ... will not be judged by the color of their   skin but the content of their character." It was a note that touched the very   heart of America. King ended is talk with the stirring lines: "Free at last!   Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!" In 1963 he became Time Magazine's   Man of the Year. In 1964 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the   youngest recipient of that prize in history. King was assassinated April 4,   1968, on the balcony outside his Memphis motel room. Perhaps no more fitting   tribute could be raised to the slain believer in the power of nonviolence than   one of his own statements: "If a man hasn't found something he will die for,   he isn't fit to live."</font></font></font><br></p><table border="0"> <tr>  <td>   <a href="javascript:void(0)"onclick="window.open('http://tellafriend.us/taf.php?formid=3','linkname','height=560, width=600,scrollbars=yes')">   <img src="images/tellfriend.gif" width="240" height="49" border="0" alt="Send this page to a friend">   </a>  </td>  <td><font face="Arial" size="2">Click <a href="http://worldbeyondborders.freezope.org/board">HERE</a> to express your ideas at the World Beyond Borders message board.</font></td>  <td>   <a href="javascript:void(0)"onclick="window.open('subscribe.htm','linkname','height=300, width=400,scrollbars=yes')">   <img src="images/subscribe.gif" width="240" heigth="49" border="0" alt="subscribe to our newsletter">   </a>  </td> </tr></table><p align="center"><a href="http://www.worldbeyondborders.org/index.htm" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Home Button','','images/homeon.jpg',1)" target="_parent"><img name="Home Button" border="0" src="images/homeoff.jpg" width="139" height="58"></a></p><!-- Start of StatCounter Code --><script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">var sc_project=220497; var sc_invisible=1; </script><script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="http://www.statcounter.com/counter/frames.js"></script><noscript><a href="http://www.statcounter.com" target="_blank"><img  src="http://c1.statcounter.com/counter.php?sc_project=220497&amp;amp;java=0" alt="Website Statistics" border="0"></a> </noscript><!-- End of StatCounter Code --></font></b></font></body></html>
